# What's New

Release notes and changelog for js-notepad.

---

## Version 1.0.26 (Upcoming)

### New Features

- **Browser (Tor) mode** — A new Tor browsing mode routes all traffic through the Tor network via SOCKS5 proxy for anonymous browsing. Ephemeral session like Incognito — no data is persisted. Requires `tor.exe` path configured in Settings → Browser Profiles. Shows a live status overlay during connection, a Tor indicator in the URL bar, and auto-stops `tor.exe` when the last Tor page closes. After session restore, a "Reconnect" button lets you resume.
- **Bookmark context menu in browser** — Right-clicking a bookmark in the bookmarks panel or blank-page bookmarks now shows a full context menu: Open in New Tab, Edit, Open in Default Browser, browser profiles, Open in Incognito, Copy URL, Pin/Unpin, Delete.
- **Pinned links context menu** — Pinned links now have the same full context menu (Edit, Open in..., Copy URL, Unpin, Delete), replacing the previous unpin-only action.
- **Rich link tooltips** — Hovering a link in the bookmarks panel, blank-page bookmarks, or pinned links panel shows a tooltip with the link's title, URL, and thumbnail image.
- **Browser internal tab reordering** — Internal browser tabs can now be reordered by dragging within the tabs panel.
- **Browser page tab sound indicator** — The sound/mute button on a browser page tab is now always visible on hover (previously it only appeared while audio was actually playing).

### Fixes and Improvements

- **Log file syntax highlighting** — `.log` files now get dedicated syntax coloring in the text editor: timestamps in muted green, log levels color-coded by severity (error in red, warn in yellow, info in cyan, debug in teal, trace in green), bracketed abbreviations like `[ERR]`/`[INF]`/`[WRN]`, quoted strings, numbers, GUIDs, URLs, hex literals, constants, and exception/stack trace lines.
- **`read_guide` MCP tool** — AI agents can now read documentation guides via a dedicated `read_guide` tool call, as an alternative to fetching `notepad://` resource URIs. This works better with AI clients that don't support MCP resources natively.
- **MCP server instructions and tool descriptions** — Rewritten to be shorter and scenario-focused, with all tool descriptions now referencing `read_guide()` alongside `notepad://` URIs for discovering documentation.
- **Browser duplicate page fix** — Fixed a bug where calling `open_url` a second time via MCP would create a duplicate browser page instead of adding a tab to the existing one.
- **Library module globals** — Library modules loaded via `require("library/...")` now have access to the same globals as the top-level script (`app`, `page`, `React`, `styledText`, `ui`, etc.). Previously, only the main script had these — library code would get a `ReferenceError`.
- **Link category normalization** — Categories with trailing slashes no longer create phantom subcategories in the link editor.

---

## Version 1.0.25

### Fixes and Improvements

- **MCP resource guides** — Three new resource guides are now available for AI agents: `notepad://guides/notebook` (notebook editor JSON format), `notepad://guides/todo` (todo editor JSON format), and `notepad://guides/links` (links editor JSON format). Agents are now directed to read the relevant guide before creating or editing these structured pages.
- **MCP input validation** — Better error messages when agents pass invalid arguments: dialog entries (`input.*`) are validated for unknown properties and missing required fields; `output.grid` content is validated to be a string and a valid JSON array; `addEditorPage` detects wrong argument types. Each error message includes a corrected usage example.
- **MCP Log page titles** — The MCP Server Log pages now use `.log.jsonl` suffixes in their titles, ensuring the Log View editor activates automatically instead of opening as plain text.
- **Graph editor** — The "Graph" view switch now only appears for `.fg.json` files or files whose content is recognized as force-graph data. It no longer shows up on arbitrary JSON files.
- **Graph legend panel** — The legend panel now always shows all five levels and all six shapes, even when the graph is new or empty, making it easier to set up before adding nodes.
- **Browser sidebar** — The Browser entry in the Tools & Editors sidebar now shows the correct cyan color, matching the browser tab icon.
- **Pinned links favicons** — Fixed favicons not appearing the first time the pinned links panel is opened.
- **Browser URL bar** — When the current page is `about:blank`, the URL bar now treats it as empty and shows recent suggestions instead of filtering by the literal text "about:blank".
- **Browser blank page bookmarks** — When a bookmarks file is configured for the current profile, opening a new browser tab now displays your bookmarks directly on the blank page. Click a link to navigate the current tab; `Ctrl+Click` opens the link in a new tab while keeping your bookmarks visible on the original. Encrypted bookmark files are not unlocked automatically — use the star button or bookmarks drawer to trigger decryption manually.
- **Page stability during grouping** — Grouping, ungrouping, closing, or reordering pages no longer causes remaining pages to reload their content. PDF documents, browser tabs, drawings, and other stateful editors now preserve their full state (scroll position, loaded content, canvas objects) through all tab operations.
- **Browser tab stability** — Closing or reordering internal browser tabs no longer causes the remaining tabs to reload. Blank-page bookmarks also preserve their scroll position when switching between tabs.
- **File Explorer context menu** — The folder context menu option was renamed from "Open in New Panel" to "Open in New Tab" for clarity.
- **MCP page content persistence** — Pages created via MCP or scripting with pre-filled content now correctly persist across app restarts. Previously the content was cached to disk but the page was not marked as modified, so the cache was never read back on restore.

---

## Version 1.0.24

### New Features

- **MCP Inspector** (early preview) — A new editor for connecting to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Supports HTTP and stdio transports, displays server info (name, version, capabilities). Open via scripting: `app.pages.showMcpInspectorPage()`. More features coming in future releases.
  - **Tools panel** — Browse and call MCP tools from a resizable sidebar. View tool details (name, description, annotations), fill in arguments via a dynamic form with type-aware inputs, and see results in a Monaco editor. Use Ctrl+Enter to call quickly.
  - **Resources panel** — Browse resources and resource templates from the server. Read resource content with a single click — renders adaptively by type (Markdown, JSON/code, images).
  - **Prompts panel** — Browse server prompts, fill in arguments, and call `getPrompt` to see returned messages with role badges.
  - **Saved connections** — Connections auto-save on successful connect. A dropdown in the connection bar lists saved servers for quick reconnect, and a connections list appears when disconnected with click-to-fill and delete.
  - **Stdio transport fix** — Fixed stdio transport connectivity that was broken by the Vite build process.
  - **Request history** — A new "History" tab in the MCP Inspector records all outgoing requests with method, duration, and error status. Click "Open in Log View" to inspect details, or "Clear" to reset.
  - **Server Info tab** — When connected, a new "Server Info" tab (shown by default) displays full server metadata: name, title, version, description, website URL (clickable), and instructions (rendered as markdown). Empty optional fields are hidden automatically.
  - **Scripting API** — `page.asMcpInspector()` facade for scripts and MCP agents: read/write connection parameters (URL, transport type, command, args, connection name), check connection status and server info, connect/disconnect programmatically, and access request history for troubleshooting. New read-only properties: `serverTitle`, `serverDescription`, `serverWebsiteUrl`, `instructions`.

- **MCP Request Log** — The MCP indicator in the title bar is now clickable — opens the "MCP Server Log" page showing all incoming MCP requests. Each log entry displays a direction arrow (incoming/outgoing), method name, detail (tool name or resource URI), duration, and error badge. Expand any entry to see full request/response JSON with syntax highlighting.

- **Tools & Editors sidebar panel** — A new panel in the sidebar (between Recent Files and Script Library) that lists all creatable editors and tools in one place. Two sections: **Pinned** (drag-to-reorder, shown in the "+" new-page menu) and **All** (alphabetically sorted). Click any item to create a new page with that editor. Pin/unpin items with a button — pinned editors are saved in settings and persist across restarts. Default pinned: Script (JS), Script (TS), Drawing, Grid (JSON), Grid (CSV), Browser. The **+** new-page dropdown menu now shows only pinned editors plus a "Show All..." option that opens the sidebar to the Tools & Editors panel. Browser profiles (Incognito, named profiles) and MCP Inspector are accessible from the panel.

- **`app.window.openMenuBar(panelId?)`** — New scripting API to open the sidebar programmatically, optionally navigating to a specific panel (e.g., `"tools-and-editors"`).

---

## Version 1.0.23

### New Features

- **Drawing Editor** — New editor for `.excalidraw` files using the Excalidraw canvas. Supports shapes, arrows, text, and freehand drawing. Self-hosted fonts for full offline support. Dark/light theme syncs with the app theme automatically. Available from the quick-add menu ("Drawing") and can switch to Monaco for raw JSON editing.
  - **Theme toggle** — independent dark/light switch for the drawing canvas
  - **Copy to clipboard** — export the drawing as a PNG image (2x scale)
  - **Save as file** — export as SVG or PNG (2x scale) via a dropdown menu
  - **Open in new tab** — open the drawing as an SVG preview or PNG image in a new tab
  - **Screen Snip** — toolbar button (scissors icon) captures a screen region and inserts it as an image into the canvas. Hides all windows, shows a dimmed overlay on each monitor, drag-select a region to capture. Escape or right-click cancels. Supports multi-monitor setups with mixed DPI scaling.
  - **Scripting API** — `page.asDraw()` facade for scripts and MCP agents: `addImage()` inserts images onto the canvas, `exportAsSvg()` and `exportAsPng()` export the drawing. `app.pages.addDrawPage(dataUrl)` creates a new drawing page with an embedded image.
  - **Library persistence** — Excalidraw library items now persist to disk and survive page close and app restart. The "Browse libraries" button opens the Excalidraw libraries site in the internal browser, and installing a library adds it directly to the editor. Library storage location is configurable via the `drawing.library-path` setting (defaults to `<userData>/data/excalidraw-lib/`).
- **Open in Drawing Editor** — SVG Preview, Image Viewer, and Mermaid Diagram editors now have an "Open in Drawing Editor" toolbar button. Embeds the image/SVG as an Excalidraw element in a new drawing tab, where you can annotate it with shapes, arrows, and text. Images are capped to 1200px on the longer side, preserving aspect ratio.

---

## Version 1.0.22

### New Features

- **Graph View Legend Panel** — A collapsible panel at the bottom-left corner of the graph editor for documenting node levels and shapes. Expand to see two tabs (Level and Shape), each listing the levels or shapes present in the graph. Check boxes to highlight matching nodes (others are dimmed); type free-form descriptions that persist to the JSON `options.legend` object. The root node appears in both tabs with a shared description. Legend highlighting integrates with existing search and link highlighting (intersection when multiple are active).

- **Graph View Node Multi-Selection** — `Ctrl+Click` to toggle individual nodes in and out of a multi-selection. The edit panel header shows "N nodes selected" and the Info tab supports batch editing of Level and Shape (mixed values highlighted in yellow). The Properties tab displays a union of all selected nodes' properties with yellow highlights for differing values. The Links tab is hidden during multi-selection. Right-clicking a selected node preserves the multi-selection. Search results status bar adds **[select all]** and **[add to selection]** actions for bulk selection from search matches.
- **Graph View Legend Selection Tab** — The Legend panel gains a new **Selection** tab with radio filters for selected/not-selected nodes, enabling quick visual isolation of multi-selected subsets.
- **Graph View Group Nodes** — Nodes with `isGroup: true` are rendered as double circles (filled inner circle with a dark blue outer ring). Group nodes use level-1 size, always-visible labels, and appear in the Legend panel with their own "Group" row in both Level and Shape tabs. Tooltips show "Group · N members" where membership is derived from links from the group to non-group nodes. Group nodes are excluded from the detail edit panel and from legend level/shape counting.

- **Graph View Group Link Pre-processing** — When groups exist in a force graph, links are automatically pre-processed for cleaner visualization. Membership links (between a group and its members) are hidden. Cross-group links (from an external node to a group member) are routed through the group node. Inter-group links (between members of different groups) are routed through both group nodes. Intra-group links (between members of the same group) are preserved as-is. Synthetic links are deduplicated with count-based distance scaling.
- **Graph View Special Node Coloring** — Root nodes and group nodes now appear in violet, making them visually distinct from regular nodes. Selection (orange) and hover (green) highlights still override the violet color.
- **Graph View Tooltip Badges** — Root nodes show a "ROOT NODE" badge and group nodes show a "GROUP" badge as the first line in their tooltip, above the title.

- **Graph View Group Management** — Full UI for creating, editing, and removing groups. Multi-select 2+ regular nodes → right-click → "Group Selected" to create a new group (prompts for title). Select one group plus regular nodes → "Group Selected" to add nodes to the existing group. Right-click a group for "Ungroup" (dissolve group, keep members), "Delete Group" (remove group and all members), or "Edit Title" (rename). Right-click a member node for "Remove from Group". `Alt+Click` a regular node while a group is selected to toggle membership. Each node can belong to only one group — reassigning silently removes from the old group. Group membership is direction-agnostic (links in either direction count).

- **Graph View Tooltip Enhancements** — Node tooltips are now hoverable — move the mouse into the tooltip to interact with its content. Two new buttons in the tooltip header: **Copy as Markdown** (copies node info as a formatted markdown table) and **Open in new page** (opens the node info as a Markdown preview page). Property values containing markdown links (`[text](url)`) are rendered as clickable links within the tooltip.

- **Graph View Selection Toolbar** — When nodes are selected, an "N selected ▾" button appears in the graph toolbar. Clicking opens a popup menu with actions: "Select children" (expand selection to neighbors), "Select members" / "Select members deep" (expand to group members), "Highlight" (open Legend panel with Selection filter), "Copy (markdown)" / "Open (markdown)" for exporting selected nodes, "Group Selected", "Extract" / "Extract with children" (create new graph from selection), and "Delete N Nodes".

- **Graph View Context Menu Enhancements** — Node context menu gains "Select children". Group node context menu gains "Select members" and "Select members deep". Multi-select delete shows "Delete N Nodes" with confirmation for 2+. "Delete Link" renamed to "Delete Link to..." for clarity.

- **Graph View Disable Grouping** — A new toggle button (violet circle icon) in the toolbar lets you disable/enable group node rendering. When grouping is enabled, the button shows a diagonal strikethrough line (click to disable). When disabled, group nodes and their membership links are stripped from the graph, and all group-related context menu items are hidden. The button is greyed out when the graph has no groups. Deleting the last member of a group now auto-deletes the empty group (including cascading cleanup of nested groups).

- **Graph View Scripting API** — New `page.asGraph()` editor facade for querying and analyzing force-graph data from scripts and MCP agents. Provides read-only access to nodes, links, selection, neighbor/group relationships, search (multi-word AND), BFS traversal, and connected component analysis. A new MCP resource `notepad://guides/graph` documents the graph data format and API.

- **Graph View `Ctrl+A` Select All** — Press `Ctrl+A` in the graph editor to select all visible nodes.

- **Graph View "Open in grid" Selection Action** — The selection toolbar menu gains an "Open in grid" action that exports selected nodes as a JSON array to a new Grid editor page.

- **Graph View Indexed Property Display** — Node properties with `key#N` indexed suffixes (e.g., `tag#1`, `tag#2`) now display with the suffix stripped in tooltips and markdown export, showing the values as a clean list under the base key name.

- **Graph View `Ctrl+F` Search Focus** — Press `Ctrl+F` in the graph editor to focus the search input.

- **Graph View Toolbar Layout** — Toolbar auto-grows to fit content (min 280px) with fixed-width search input (130px).

- **Callable `await ui()` Yield** — Long-running scripts can now call `await ui()` to yield to the event loop, preventing the UI from freezing. Insert `await ui()` inside heavy loops to let the interface remain responsive during processing.

### Improvements

- **Graph View UI polish** — Node labels now scale font size by level (larger nodes get bigger text). Selection highlight reworked: selected node label is orange, hovered node and its children get green labels. Tooltips no longer appear during node drag. Edit panel tabs reordered to Info → Properties → Links. Links tab now shows all columns (ID, Title, Level, Shape + custom properties) with auto-detected widths and sticky ID column.
- **Graph View toolbar and panel UX** — Collapsed search toolbar stays visible with a green border when a search is active. Clicking on empty canvas collapses expanded panels without changing selection. Legend panel chevron turns green when expanded (replaces the previous green border indicator).
- **Graph View group membership detection** — Group membership now works with links in either direction (group→member or member→group), making group setup more flexible.
- **Graph View BFS visibility** — Initial visibility calculation now uses real graph depth instead of discovery order, producing more accurate node visibility for complex graphs. Focus node starts component detection so connected graphs no longer show disconnected clusters.
- **Graph View path highlighting** — Selecting a node now highlights the full visual path (orange) to all its real neighbors, including through group nodes. When hovering a node while another is selected, the green highlight also traces the full visual path through groups. The Links tab hover highlights only the selected node's children (not the hovered child's neighbors).
- **Graph View detail panel persistence** — Clicking a different node while the detail panel is expanded now keeps it open and updates the panel with the new selection, instead of collapsing it. Clicking the empty canvas still collapses.
- **Graph View "Selected with children" highlighting** — The Legend panel's Selection tab gains a new **Selected with children** radio option that highlights selected nodes plus all their visual and real neighbors. Hold **Shift** as a keyboard shortcut to temporarily apply this highlighting without opening the Legend panel.
- **Graph View Reset View button** — Now always enabled (previously disabled when no visibility filter was active). Resets BFS visibility and restarts the D3 simulation, re-compacting drifted nodes.
- **Graph View Expand All button** — Now hidden when no visibility filter is active, instead of showing as disabled.
- **Graph View Legend + Search interaction** — When search highlighting is active and the Legend panel is expanded, the Legend shows a "Search highlighting is active" message with a "Clear search" button instead of the normal tabs/content.
- **Graph View Legend Panel tab order** — The Selection tab is now the first and default tab in the Legend panel (previously the order was Level, Shape, Selection).
- **Graph View "Open link" context menu** — Right-clicking a node whose custom properties contain markdown links (`[text](path)`) now shows "Open {property}" at the top of the context menu. When multiple links exist, a "Open link..." submenu lists each one.
- **Graph View tooltip suppression** — Tooltips no longer appear while a context menu is open.

## Version 1.0.21

### New Features

- **Graph View Editor** — A force-directed graph viewer for `.fg.json` files. Also activates for any JSON file containing `"type": "force-graph"` and a `"nodes"` property. Click **Graph** in the toolbar to switch between the text editor and the graph view. Supports zoom (scroll wheel), pan (drag canvas), node dragging, click-to-select with neighbor highlighting, and hover highlighting. Node labels appear for selected/hovered nodes at sufficient zoom levels. Graph colors adapt to all 9 app themes. See [Editors](./editors.md#graph-view) for details.
- **Graph View node properties** — Nodes now support `title` (display label), `level` (size tier 1–5; level 1 is largest), and `shape` (`circle`, `square`, `diamond`, `triangle`, `star`, `hexagon`). Level 1 and 2 nodes always display their label. Labels show `title` if present, otherwise `id`.
- **Graph View collapse/expand** — Large graphs automatically show only the closest nodes (up to `maxVisible`, default 500). Nodes with hidden neighbors display a "+" badge — click to expand. New graph JSON `options` object supports `focus` (initial focus node ID), `expandDepth` (BFS depth limit), and `maxVisible` (node visibility cap). A **Reset View** toolbar button restores the initial visibility state.
- **Graph View search** — Search input in the graph toolbar supports multi-word AND matching across title, ID, and custom property names/values. An expandable results panel below the toolbar lists matching nodes with highlighted matches; hidden nodes appear at reduced opacity and can be clicked to reveal. Keyboard navigation with ArrowUp/Down, Enter to select, Escape to close. Status bar shows visible match count and a clickable "+N hidden" link for bulk reveal. The toolbar now has Settings and Results tabs for switching between force tuning and search results.
- **Graph View node tooltips** — Hovering over a graph node for ~500 ms shows an HTML tooltip with the node's title, id, and any custom user-defined properties. Known properties (`level`, `shape`) and internal D3 properties are excluded.
- **Graph View editing** — Right-click context menu for graph editing: "Add Node" on empty canvas, "Add Child" / "Delete Node" / "Delete Link" submenu on nodes. Alt+Click on a node toggles a link with the selected node. All edits serialize to clean JSON preserving existing node positions. Reset View shows disconnected components as root + one level of children.
- **Graph View detail panel** — A collapsible overlay panel at the top-right corner of the graph editor for editing node properties. Click the header to expand/collapse; double-click a node to expand. The panel auto-collapses when deselecting nodes. The Info tab provides editable fields for ID (with rename validation), Title, Level (1–5 icon selector), and Shape (6 shape icons). Changes immediately update the canvas and JSON. The panel is resizable via a bottom-left drag handle.
- **Graph View force tuning** — A gear icon in the graph toolbar toggles an expandable tuning panel with three sliders: Charge (-200 to 0), Distance (10 to 200), and Collide (0 to 1). Sliders update the force simulation in real time. Reset button restores defaults. Force parameters are transient (not saved to JSON). The toolbar is semi-transparent when idle and becomes fully opaque on hover or interaction.
- **Graph View Links tab** — The detail panel now includes a Links tab showing all nodes linked to the selected node in an editable grid. Three column presets (Default, View, Custom) control which properties are visible. Supports batch editing with Apply/Cancel, adding new linked nodes (including paste from Excel), and deleting rows with smart orphan removal. When the Links tab is active, non-linked nodes are dimmed on the canvas; focusing a grid row highlights the corresponding node in green and draws a green link line to it. Hidden children are auto-expanded when the tab is activated.
- **Graph View Properties tab** — The detail panel now includes a Properties tab showing all custom (non-core) key-value properties of the selected node in an editable grid. Supports inline editing, add/delete rows, copy/paste from spreadsheets, and Apply/Cancel batch workflow. Reserved keys (id, title, level, shape, system keys) are validated and blocked.
- **"Open in New Panel" for folders** — All folders in the File Explorer panel now have an **Open in New Panel** option in the right-click context menu. This opens the folder in a new File Explorer tab alongside the current editor. Previously this was only accessible by double-clicking linked sidebar folders.
- **Graph View settings persistence** — Physics settings (Charge, Distance, Collide) are now saved to the JSON `options` object and restored when the file is reopened. The toolbar's **Settings** tab has been renamed to **Physics**, and a new **Expansion** tab provides controls for Root Node (dropdown), Expand Depth, and Max Visible. The `options.focus` field has been renamed to `options.rootNode` in the JSON format.
- **Graph View root node** — The root node now has a distinct visual appearance: a compass (4-pointed star) shape, level-1 size, and an always-visible label. Right-click any node and choose **Set as Root** to designate it as the root node.
- **Graph View deep expand** — `Ctrl+Click` on a badge (+N) performs a "deep expand", revealing the entire hidden subtree connected to that node. Already-visible nodes act as barriers, so the expansion stops at nodes that are already shown. Regular click still expands one layer at a time.
- **Graph View Expand All** — New **Expand All** button in the graph toolbar (next to Reset View) makes all nodes visible at once. When the graph has more than 1,000 nodes, a confirmation dialog warns about potential performance impact before proceeding.
- **Graph View quick-add** — "Force Graph" added to the **+** dropdown menu on the tab bar, creating a new `.fg.json` page ready for editing.
- **Graph View file icon** — `.fg.json` files now display a custom graph icon (nodes and links) in the tab bar.
- **Graph View status bar** — The footer shows "N of M nodes" when visibility filtering is active, or "N nodes" when all nodes are visible.
- **Graph View empty page helper** — New empty graph pages display a centered hint: "Right-click → Add Node".
- **Graph View collapse** — Right-click a node and choose **Collapse** to hide its descendant nodes. This is the inverse of expand — useful for tidying up a large graph after exploring a subtree. Only available when visibility filtering is active.
- **Graph View canvas focus** — Clicking the graph canvas now properly dismisses open popup menus.

## Version 1.0.20

### New Features

- **Browse ZIP archives** — Open ZIP-based archives directly in the File Explorer panel. Right-click an archive in the file tree and choose **Open as Archive**, or double-click it in the sidebar navigation panel, to browse its contents as a folder tree. Supported formats: `.zip`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.jar`, `.war`, `.epub`, `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`. Navigate up from the archive root to return to the parent folder. Text-based files (XML, JSON, etc.) open in Monaco editor for inspection. File operations (create, rename, delete files and folders) work inside archives just like in regular folders.
- **Browse `.asar` archives** — Electron `.asar` archive files can now be browsed in the File Explorer panel, just like ZIP archives. Right-click and choose **Open as Archive**, or double-click in the sidebar. Files inside `.asar` open in Monaco editor for inspection. `.asar` archives are read-only — file operations (create, rename, delete) are disabled inside them.
- **Archive visual indicators** — Archive files now show a small clickable badge icon next to their name in the file tree (File Explorer panel and sidebar). Click the badge to open the archive in a new tab — a shortcut to **Open as Archive**. When browsing inside an archive, a banner appears at the top of the navigation panel: ZIP archives show "Archive content"; `.asar` archives show ".asar is read-only". File operations (rename, delete, new file/folder) and the search button are automatically hidden while inside an archive.
- **MCP `open_url` Tool** — AI agents can now open URLs in the [built-in browser](./browser.md) via the new `open_url` MCP tool. Supports optional `profileName` and `incognito` parameters for browser profile selection and private browsing.

### Improvements

- **Archive path support in `app.fs`** — All file system methods now transparently work with files inside ZIP archives using the `!` path separator (e.g., `"D:/temp/doc.zip!word/document.xml"`). Read, write, stat, list, and delete operations are all supported. See the [fs API reference](./api/fs.md#archive-paths) for details.
- **Extended `app.fs` API** — Five new file system methods for scripting: `rename`, `copyFile`, `stat`, `listDirWithTypes`, and `removeDir`. See the [fs API reference](./api/fs.md) for details.
- **MCP `create_page` error handling** — Calling `create_page` with a page-editor type (browser-view, pdf-view, image-view) now returns a clear error message explaining how to use `open_url` or `execute_script` instead, rather than crashing.
- **Popup rate limiting** — Browser popup/tab blocking now uses a single app-wide limiter (max 3 per 2 seconds) instead of per-tab limits, preventing cascade attacks where each new tab opens more tabs.

---

## Version 1.0.19

### New Features

- **Log View Editor** — A structured log viewer for `.log.jsonl` files that renders typed log entries with virtualized scrolling
  - **Message entries** — five log levels (`info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, `debug`) with level-appropriate text colors
  - **Styled text** — rich text with per-segment foreground/background colors and bold/italic formatting
  - **Interactive dialogs** — three dialog types render inline within the log stream:
    - `input.confirm` — message with Yes/No buttons
    - `input.text` — title, text input field, and action buttons
    - `input.buttons` — array of clickable buttons
    - `input.checkboxes` — list of checkboxes with optional title and layout modes
    - `input.radioboxes` — single-selection radio button group with optional title and layout modes
    - `input.select` — dropdown select with search/filter and keyboard navigation
  - Dialogs have **pending** (active border, clickable) and **resolved** (dim border, disabled, check icon on chosen button) states
  - `!` prefix on button names marks them as "required" — disabled until the text field has a value
  - Text input values and dialog results persist to the JSONL content immediately (text input debounced at 300ms)
  - Auto-scroll to bottom when new entries appear
  - Toolbar buttons: **Clear log** (removes all entries) and **timestamps toggle** (off by default)

- **MCP `ui_push` Tool** — AI agents can now push log entries and interactive dialogs to a Log View page via the new `ui_push` MCP tool
  - **Log entries** — `log.text`, `log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error`, `log.success` for styled status messages
  - **Interactive dialogs** — `input.confirm`, `input.text`, `input.buttons`, `input.checkboxes`, `input.radioboxes`, `input.select` render inline in the Log View; the tool blocks until the user responds
  - **String shorthand** — plain strings in the entries array are treated as `log.info`
  - **Automatic page management** — Log View page is created on first call, reused on subsequent calls, and recreated if the user closes it
  - Recommended output channel for AI agents — prefer `ui_push` over `create_page` for showing status, results, and asking questions

- **Checkboxes Dialog** — New `ui.dialog.checkboxes()` method for scripts and `input.checkboxes` entry for MCP `ui_push`
  - Items can be strings or `{ label, checked? }` objects with pre-checked state
  - Two layout modes: `"vertical"` (one per row, default) and `"flex"` (items wrap horizontally)
  - `!` prefix on buttons disables them until at least one item is checked
  - Result includes `items` array with updated `checked` state

- **Radioboxes Dialog** — New `ui.dialog.radioboxes()` method for scripts and `input.radioboxes` entry for MCP `ui_push`
  - Items are plain strings (single-selection radio button group)
  - Two layout modes: `"vertical"` (one per row, default) and `"flex"` (items wrap horizontally)
  - Pre-selected item via `checked` option
  - `!` prefix on buttons disables them until an item is selected
  - Result includes `checked` field with the selected item label

- **Progress Bar** — New `ui.show.progress()` method for scripts and `output.progress` entry for MCP `ui_push`
  - Shows a progress bar inline in the Log View with label, value, max, and completed state

- **Mermaid Output** — New `ui.show.mermaid()` method for scripts and `output.mermaid` entry for MCP `ui_push`
  - Render Mermaid diagrams inline in the Log View with theme-aware rendering (light/dark)
  - Two overloads: `ui.show.mermaid(text)` for quick display, `ui.show.mermaid({ text, title? })` for adding a title
  - Returns a `Mermaid` helper with live `text` and `title` setters for real-time updates, plus `openInEditor()` to open in the Mermaid editor
  - Hover toolbar with "Copy image to clipboard" and "Open in Mermaid editor" buttons
  - MCP agents use `output.mermaid` entries with `text` and optional `title`

- **Grid Output** — New `ui.show.grid()` method for scripts and `output.grid` entry for MCP `ui_push`
  - Display tabular data inline in the Log View using a full-featured grid (AVGrid)
  - Two overloads: `ui.show.grid(data)` for quick display, `ui.show.grid({ data, columns?, title? })` for custom columns and title
  - Column definitions can be strings (key names) or objects with `key`, `title`, `width`, and `dataType` properties
  - Returns a `Grid` helper with live `data`, `columns`, and `title` setters for real-time updates
  - `openInEditor(pageTitle?)` opens the data in a dedicated Grid editor tab
  - Grid supports column resizing, column reordering, cell selection, and copy-to-clipboard
  - Hover toolbar with "Open in Grid editor" button
  - MCP agents use `output.grid` entries with `content` (JSON or CSV string), optional `contentType` (`"json"` or `"csv"`), and optional `title`

- **Text Output** — New `ui.show.text()` method for scripts and `output.text` entry for MCP `ui_push`
  - Display syntax-highlighted text inline in the Log View using an embedded Monaco editor (read-only)
  - Two overloads: `ui.show.text("code", "javascript")` for quick display, `ui.show.text({ text, language?, title?, wordWrap?, lineNumbers?, minimap? })` for full control
  - Defaults: language `"plaintext"`, wordWrap `true`, lineNumbers `false`, minimap `false`

  - Pre-selected item via `selected` option, customizable placeholder text
  - `!` prefix on buttons disables them until an item is selected
  - Result includes `selected` field with the chosen item label

### Improvements

- **Console Forwarding to Log View** — When a script uses `ui`, `console.log/info/warn/error` are automatically forwarded to the Log View (`console.log` maps to lighter `log.log` text, `console.info` → `log.info`, etc.). The native console is always called. Suppress forwarding per level with `ui.preventConsoleLog()`, `ui.preventConsoleWarn()`, or `ui.preventConsoleError()`. MCP scripts with `ui` send console output to both the MCP response and the Log View.
- **`ui.log()` Lighter Text** — `ui.log()` now renders with lighter text (`log.log` level), visually distinct from `ui.text()` which uses normal text color (`log.text` level)
- **Fluent Styled Text in Log View** — `ui.log()`, `ui.info()`, `ui.warn()`, `ui.error()`, `ui.success()`, and `ui.text()` now return a builder for fluent chaining: `ui.log("Status: ").append("OK").color("lime").bold().print()`. Existing code that ignores the return value is unaffected.
- **`styledText()` Global** — New standalone function for building styled text outside the Log View, for use in dialog labels and anywhere styled text is accepted: `const label = styledText("Warning").color("red").bold().value;`
- **Dialog Two-Overload Pattern** — All `ui.dialog` methods (`confirm`, `buttons`, `textInput`) now support two calling styles: a simple form with positional arguments (e.g., `confirm("message", buttons?)`) and a full form with a single options object (e.g., `confirm({ message, buttons? })`)
- **Log View Dialog UX** — Dialogs now have fit-content width, improved button padding, and auto-scroll to bottom when a new dialog appears
- **Log View Rendering** — Fixed empty lines growing unexpectedly, eliminated height jumping for new rows, and improved auto-scroll reliability
- **JSONL Language Support** — Syntax highlighting for `.jsonl` and `.ndjson` files (JSON Lines format) with dedicated file icon
- **Grid View for JSONL** — Switch to Grid editor for `.jsonl`/`.ndjson` files to view, sort, filter, and edit data as a spreadsheet

### Bug Fixes

- **ScriptRunner Block Closers** — Scripts ending with block-closing syntax like `});` no longer fail with syntax errors

### Internal

- **Flat Log Entry Format** — Log entries in `.log.jsonl` files and MCP `ui_push` now use a flat object structure (e.g., `{ type: "log.info", text: "Hello" }`) instead of the previous `{ type, data }` wrapper. Dialog entries are flat too (e.g., `{ type: "input.confirm", message: "Sure?", buttons: ["Yes", "No"] }`). Dialog results return the full flat entry object.
- **Editor Error Boundary** — Editors that fail to render now show an error message with stack trace in the tab instead of crashing the application
- **Log Entry Error Boundary** — Individual log entries that fail to render show an error stub instead of crashing the entire Log View

## Version 1.0.18

### New Features

- **Library Imports in Scripts** — Use `require("library/...")` to import reusable modules from your linked Script Library folder
  - Both `.ts` and `.js` files supported — TypeScript is transpiled automatically
  - Extension auto-resolution: `.ts`, `.js`, `/index.ts`, `/index.js` tried automatically
  - Relative requires within library modules work (e.g., `require('./db-config')`)
  - Cache invalidated between runs when source files change
  - Clear error message when no library folder is linked

- **Script Library** — A dedicated sidebar entry for quick access to your reusable script collection
  - Link any folder as your Script Library via the sidebar or Settings → Script Library
  - Browse and open scripts from the sidebar's right panel (File Explorer view)
  - Context menu: Change Library Folder, Open in Explorer, Unlink Library
  - Settings page section with path display, Browse button, and Unlink button

- **IntelliSense for Library Modules** — When a Script Library folder is linked, Monaco now provides autocomplete and type information for `require("library/...")` calls
  - **Path completion** — typing `require("library/` auto-suggests folders and files; selecting a folder re-triggers suggestions to drill deeper; files shown without extension
  - Exported functions, variables, and types from library `.ts`/`.js` files appear in autocomplete with parameter types, return types, and JSDoc documentation
  - Updates live when library files are modified
  - Built-in `require()` and `preventOutput()` also show in autocomplete with documentation

- **Library Setup Wizard** — Linking a Script Library folder now opens a setup dialog instead of a raw folder picker
  - Folder path input with Browse button
  - "Copy example scripts" checkbox (on by default) populates the folder with bundled starter scripts: general-purpose examples, text utilities, JSON formatters, and a shared helper module
  - Existing files are never overwritten — safe to run on a folder that already has scripts
  - Triggered from the sidebar "Select Folder", Settings "Browse...", and Script Panel save (when no library is linked)

- **Script Panel — Script Selector & Save** — The Script Panel toolbar now includes a dropdown to browse and load saved scripts from your library, plus a Save button to store scripts for reuse
  - Script selector lists scripts from `script-panel/{language}/` and `script-panel/all/` folders in the library
  - Scripts from the "all" folder shown with "all/" prefix to distinguish them
  - Select a script to load it; choose "(unsaved script)" for ad-hoc editing
  - Save button for ad-hoc scripts opens a dialog with filename input and folder selection (language-specific or "all")
  - Save button for library scripts directly overwrites when content is modified
  - `Ctrl+S` shortcut works when the Script Panel editor is focused
  - Folders created automatically as needed; overwrite confirmation for existing files

### Bug Fixes

- **Library `.js` ES Module Support** — `.js` files in the Script Library using `export`/`import` syntax now work correctly. Previously only `.ts` files were transpiled; `.js` files with ES module syntax would fail at runtime

- **Example Script Fixes** — All bundled example scripts now use browser APIs (`btoa`/`atob`) instead of `Buffer.from()`, which is not available in the script sandbox. The `parse-jwt-token` script now strips "Bearer " prefix automatically. The `format-json` script now sets the output language to JSON for proper syntax highlighting.

### Improvements

- **Script Library — Open in New Tab** — Double-click the Script Library sidebar entry (or click its icon when selected) to open it in a new tab with the File Explorer panel, just like custom linked folders

- **Script Panel — Open in New Tab** — New toolbar button opens the currently selected script (or an empty page) in a new tab with the File Explorer panel rooted at the `script-panel/` folder

- **Structured Editor Auto-Detection** — JSON content created via MCP or scripting now embeds a `type` property (`"note-editor"`, `"todo-editor"`, or `"link-editor"`), so the correct editor switch button (Notebook, ToDo, or Links) appears in the toolbar automatically — even without the `.note.json`/`.todo.json`/`.link.json` file extension

---

## Version 1.0.17

### New Features

- **AI Agent Integration (MCP HTTP Server)** — external AI agents (such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or Gemini) can now connect to js-notepad and control it programmatically via HTTP
  - Server listens on `http://localhost:7865/mcp` (port is configurable via the `mcp.port` setting)
  - Connect any MCP-compatible client by pointing it to the server URL
  - Dedicated **MCP Server** section in Settings with enable/disable toggle, port input, live status indicator (green/red dot), **Copy URL** and **Copy Config** buttons
  - Disabled by default — enable with a single checkbox in Settings → MCP Server
  - Port is configurable in Settings (default: `7865`); disable MCP first, change the port, then re-enable
  - Server is bound to localhost only (127.0.0.1) and is not accessible from other machines
  - Available tools: `execute_script`, `list_pages`, `get_page_content`, `get_active_page`, `create_page`, `set_page_content`, `get_app_info`
  - Console output (`console.log`, `console.error`, etc.) from scripts executed via MCP is captured and returned to the agent
  - **API Guide resources** — AI clients can read focused guides (`notepad://guides/ui-push`, `notepad://guides/pages`, `notepad://guides/scripting`) or the full combined reference (`notepad://guides/full`) directly from the MCP server. Server instructions provide immediate context on connection.
  - **Title bar MCP indicator** — when the MCP server is active, a small indicator (green dot + "MCP" label) appears in the title bar with a live connection count; hidden when MCP is disabled
  - **Multi-window support** — all MCP tools accept an optional `windowIndex` parameter to target specific windows. New `list_windows` tool discovers all windows (open and closed) with their pages. New `open_window` tool reopens closed windows with their persisted pages
  - See [MCP Server Setup](./mcp-setup.md) for configuration instructions

- **TypeScript Script Execution** — scripts now support TypeScript in addition to JavaScript
  - Write scripts with type annotations (interfaces, typed variables, etc.) — types are stripped automatically before execution
  - The Script Panel uses TypeScript by default, accepting both plain JavaScript and TypeScript seamlessly
  - Press `F5` on `.ts` files to execute them, just like `.js` files
  - Notebook notes with TypeScript language show a Run button and can be executed
  - **Quick Add: Script (TS)** — new option in the tab bar's "+" dropdown menu to create a TypeScript script page
  - MCP `execute_script` tool accepts an optional `language` parameter (`"javascript"` or `"typescript"`)

- **Text Dialog** — new `app.ui.textDialog()` method that opens a Monaco-based dialog for displaying or editing multi-line text
  - Configurable title, buttons, read-only mode, and dialog dimensions
  - Monaco editor options: language for syntax highlighting, word wrap, minimap, line numbers
  - Useful for showing error details, editing SQL queries, reviewing logs, or getting multi-line input from scripts

- **Output Suppression** — scripts can now prevent the default output to the grouped page
  - Call `preventOutput()` to explicitly suppress output (e.g., when showing results in a dialog)
  - Writing to `page.grouped.content` directly now automatically suppresses default output
  - When output is suppressed and an error occurs, the error is shown in a text dialog instead

- **`page.runScript()`** — new method to programmatically run a JavaScript/TypeScript page as a script (equivalent to pressing F5), returning the result as text

### Improvements

- **Todo Editor Scripting** — 4 new methods on the `asTodo()` facade: `selectList(name)`, `selectTag(name)`, `setSearch(text)`, `clearSearch()` — allowing scripts and MCP agents to navigate and filter the todo UI programmatically

- **MCP `create_page` Editor Validation** — passing an invalid editor ID to `create_page` now returns a descriptive error with the list of valid editor IDs, instead of silently failing

- **MCP Lazy Loading** — the MCP SDK is now loaded on-demand when the server starts, rather than at app startup. Combined with a 1.5s deferred auto-start, this improves application launch time for all users

- **Markdown Preview — Mermaid "Open in Editor"** — hover over an inline mermaid diagram to see a toolbar with two buttons: copy image to clipboard, and open the diagram source in a new Mermaid editor tab

- **External Link Routing** — external links now prefer the active browser page when one is available. Empty browser tabs (`about:blank`) are reused instead of opening a new tab

- **Image Viewer — Save Image to File** — URL-based images now have a "Save Image to File" button in the toolbar that downloads the image and saves it to disk, then switches to file mode

- **Link Editor — Image URL Clear Button** — the Image URL field in the Edit Link dialog now has a clear (X) button for quickly removing the image

- **Monaco Minimap Click** — clicking on the minimap background now scrolls directly to that position in the document

- **Auto-Hiding Scrollbars** — tree views and grids now use VSCode-like auto-hiding scrollbars that appear on hover, reducing visual clutter

- **Sidebar Folder Double-Click** — double-clicking a folder in the sidebar now opens it in a NavigationPanel tab

### Bug Fixes

- **NavigationPanel Folder State** — fixed expanded folder state being lost on first navigation in NavigationPanel

---

## Version 1.0.16

### New Features

- **Browser Editor — Download Manager** — download progress tracking and history in the browser toolbar
  - **Download button** with circular progress ring that animates while downloads are active (icon turns active color)
  - Click the button to open a **Downloads popup** listing all downloads (most recent first)
  - Active downloads show a progress bar with received/total bytes and a **Cancel** button
  - Completed downloads show **Open** (launches file with default app) and **Show in Folder** (opens Explorer with file selected) buttons
  - Failed or cancelled downloads display status text
  - **Clear** button to dismiss completed and failed entries
  - Global download list — shared across all browser pages and windows
  - Last 5 completed downloads are persisted and restored on app restart
  - Uses the native OS save dialog for choosing download location

### Improvements

- **Browser Editor — Find in Page** — `Ctrl+F` now opens a proper inline search bar (replacing the `prompt()` dialog):
  - Match counter showing "3 of 15" or "No results"
  - Next/Previous navigation with `Enter`/`Shift+Enter` or `F3`/`Shift+F3`
  - Close with `Escape` or close button — clears all highlights
  - Works when focus is inside the web page (via main process key interception)
  - Auto-closes on page navigation or tab switch

- **Browser Editor — Keyboard Shortcuts** — standard browser hotkeys now work regardless of focus location:
  - `F5` — Reload page
  - `Ctrl+F5` / `Ctrl+Shift+R` — Hard reload (bypass cache)
  - `Ctrl+R` — Reload (alias)
  - `F12` — Open DevTools
  - `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` — Back / Forward
  - `Alt+Home` — Navigate to the tab's home page
  - `Escape` — Stop loading

- **Browser Editor — Automatic Cache Cleanup** — when a browser page is closed, HTTP cache, compiled code cache, and service worker caches are automatically cleared to save disk space. Cookies, localStorage, and other site data are preserved so you stay logged in.

- **Browser Editor — Popup Blocking** — sites that try to spam popup windows or internal tabs are now rate-limited (max 3 within 2 seconds). A notification bar appears when popups are blocked, with an "Allow" button to temporarily permit popups for that page.

- **Link Editor — Browser Selector Button** — toolbar button to choose where links open: OS default browser, internal browser, a specific browser profile, or incognito mode. Initialized from the app setting, adjustable per session.

- **Link Editor — Hostnames Panel** — new collapsible panel in the sidebar showing hostnames extracted from all links, allowing quick filtering by hostname.

- **Link Context Menu — Browser Profiles** — right-click context menu on links in Link Editor, Markdown Preview, and pinned links now includes all configured browser profiles (not just Default/Internal/Incognito).

- **Link Editor — Session State Persistence** — selected category, tag, hostname, and expanded panel are remembered across app restarts (restored when reopening the same file).

- **Todo Editor — Session State Persistence** — selected list and tag are remembered across app restarts.

- **Pinned Tab Tooltip** — hovering over a pinned tab now shows the full file path in a tooltip (with a 1.5s delay), making it easy to identify pinned files without unpinning them.

- **Lightweight Launcher** — new `js-notepad-launcher.exe` (308KB Rust binary) for near-instant file opening via Named Pipe. When js-notepad is already running, files and URLs are delivered in under 50ms instead of ~1 second. Supports file paths, URLs, relative paths, and diff mode for Git Extensions integration.

- **Register as Default Browser** — js-notepad can now register itself as a Windows default browser, so clicking links in other applications (email, chat, documents) opens them in js-notepad's built-in browser editor.
  - **Settings → Default Browser** section with Register / Unregister buttons and status indicator
  - "Open Windows Default Apps" button navigates directly to the JS-Notepad page in Windows Settings
  - Registry keys written to HKCU (no admin required)
  - URLs from the OS always open in the internal browser tab using the default profile
  - Works on cold start and when js-notepad is already running (via the launcher's named pipe)

- **NSIS Installer** — production builds now use electron-builder with a custom NSIS installer featuring an options page: desktop/start menu shortcuts, Explorer context menu ("Open with js-notepad"), file associations, and browser registration.

### Bug Fixes

- **Default Browser — External URL Routing** — fixed an issue where clicking links in external applications (when js-notepad is the default browser) could create duplicate browser pages instead of reusing the existing one. External URLs now correctly find the first browser page with the default profile and add a new internal tab there.

---

## Version 1.0.15

### Improvements

- **Link Editor Enhancements**
  - **Favicons** — cached favicons from the internal browser displayed next to links in list view and as tile fallback; favicons also saved when opening links via "Open in Internal Browser" from standalone `.link.json` files
  - **Drag-and-drop** — drag links onto categories to reassign them; drag categories onto other categories to reparent (with confirmation dialog showing affected link count)
  - **Pinned links panel** — pin important links via right-click → "Pin"; pinned panel on the right edge shows favicon + title, auto-hides when empty, resizable via splitter, with drag-to-reorder support

---

## Version 1.0.14

### New Features

    - Closes on Escape, backdrop click, or after link click navigation
  - **Context menu bookmarking** — right-click a link or tile on a web page → "Add to Bookmarks" with captured URL, title, and image
  - **Image discovery** — collects candidate images from multiple sources:
    - Page meta tags (`og:image`, `twitter:image`, etc.)
    - Images inside clicked `<a>` elements (captured before navigation)
    - "Use Image for Bookmark" context menu on right-clicked images
    - Per-tab image tracking with navigation levels (remembers images from previous pages)
  - **Per-profile bookmarks files** — each browser profile (Default, named, Incognito) can have its own `.link.json` bookmarks file, configured in **Settings → Browser Profiles**
  - Bookmarks fully functional in incognito mode
  - Supports encrypted `.link.json` files with async password dialog
  - All edits auto-save to the bookmarks file

### Improvements

- **Async Password Dialog** — The file encryption/decryption password prompt is now a standalone async dialog (`showPasswordDialog`) that can be used from any code path, replacing the previous inline panel in the text editor. Same dialog pattern as other app dialogs (confirmation, input).

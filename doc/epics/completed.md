## EPIC-091 — `call` surface hardening: acting on the external MCP evaluation

Completed 2026-09-07. [Epic document](EPIC-091.md), [source report](EPIC-091-evaluation-report.md).
Not part of the agent transparency roadmap — the **first outside audit of what that roadmap built**.

An independent agent with no project context, no guide, and an intent to break things evaluated the
single-tool `call` surface and reported 7 bugs, a systemic silent-no-op class, 8 consistency issues
and 10 prioritised recommendations. **All sixteen of its claims were replayed live before any fix
and every one reproduced.** That is the finding that set the epic's posture: the report was treated
as evidence rather than as opinion.

**What it did not say is the more important half.** It did not say the design is wrong — it said the
opposite, at length. Discovery works, the error messages are better than most MCP servers ship, the
unsaved-changes dialog interception is "better agent-safety design than I see in most MCP servers".
The roadmap's central bet — one path-based tool plus live hints beats thirty-four tool descriptions
— was taken up by a stranger and it held. What it found was that the surface was **half-finished in
one specific way**: about half of it validated its arguments and the other half did not validate
them at all, which produces the single worst failure mode an agent surface can have — a call that
reports success and did nothing.

**The report's central recommendation was wrong, and finding that out was the epic's main planning
work.** It said "you already have an argument-validation helper — apply it uniformly", and named
four sites. No such helper exists: the four do not share code, the pattern is re-implemented ad hoc
in at least eleven places, and `deleteRows` — the site quoted as the gold standard — has **no
validation at all**; the message attributed to it is nowhere in the codebase. US-1356 had to extract
the validator before it could apply it, and the site the report praised turned out to be a
thirteenth silent no-op it had missed.

**Two of its "documentation" findings were single-line fixes with tree-wide effect.** The dead hint
path (1.5) was not an `addEditorPage` wording problem but the resolver building hint paths from
`walked`, which includes the call segment — affecting every method in the tree that returns a node.
The hint leak (1.2) was three call sites passing one `forceMembers` flag that bypassed both the
dedupe and the mode check; the report counted six dumps but attributed all of them to that path,
when two came from a fourth leak it had not isolated — the malformed-path branch hard-coding
`hints: "always"`.

**And the epic found two silent no-ops the report did not.** `logView.push(123)` returned
`{ entryIds: [], dialogIds: [] }` — a success-shaped result for input that did nothing — and
`addEditorPage`'s fourth `content` argument was dropped by the scripting wrapper while the arity
error advertised it, so an agent following the surface's own copy-paste example created a page with
its content discarded and got success back. Fourteen in total, from a report that found twelve.

**One recommendation was declined with reasons** (decision 5): the uniform `{ ok: true }` for
mutations. It would have changed every void member across seven epics against sixteen QA surface
files, and two of the five shapes carry information the envelope would lose. The shapes are
documented in `$help` instead. The one return that *was* changed is `pages.closePage` on an unknown
id, which now throws with the open page ids — deliberate, agent-visible, and in whats-new.

**The measurable result** is hint economics. A first unknown member of a kind still returns the
complete member list (~2,500 bytes); a second returns the kind summary plus a `$help` pointer
(~200 bytes). Report item 1.2 asked for that ratio, and the member list survived — which was
US-1355's abort criterion, because the same report listed it among the behaviours worth preserving.
Near-match suggestions are what made the dedupe safe rather than a trade.

**The acceptance run passed** ([run log](../../qa/runs/2026-09-07-epic-091-malformed-input.md)) and
left `qa/surfaces/malformed-input.md` behind — the one file in that suite whose surface is not a
screen. Nothing on the report's preserve list regressed; the unsaved-changes interception was
checked twice, because `closePage` gained argument validation. The Haiku agent volunteered the
epic's own thesis back: *"the tool validates arguments and suggests alternatives before execution"*
— which across half this surface was untrue the day before.

Live verification changed two shipped designs and `/review` caught a third. `pagez` ties between
`pages` and `page`, so the reviewed plan's "a tie means no suggestion" rule sent the full dump for
the most likely typo on the surface; the matcher now names every equally-good candidate. Trimming
script stack traces dropped the caller's *own* frames too, because a script frame names an internal
file in its eval origin while carrying the real position in `<anonymous>`. And `arrayOfChoicesRule`
compared an array against the choices as a whole, so *every* `deleteRows` call with valid keys threw
— caught at epic close, not by the per-task smoke tests, which had only exercised the error path.

  - [x] US-1354: Guard `logView.push` against a non-array argument — plus the silent skip and the partial-batch write behind it
  - [x] US-1355: Hint economics — `hints` honoured on errors, `forceMembers` dedupe, near-match suggestions, and a fourth leak in the parse-error branch
  - [x] US-1356: Extract the argument validator and end the silent no-op class — thirteen sites, `closePage` brought to `showPage`'s standard
  - [x] US-1357: `call` parameter bounds — `limit` clamp, schema minimums, `maxLength` for structured results
  - [x] US-1358: Language validation at the argument boundary, returned-object identity in hints, grid row keys exposed
  - [x] US-1359: Surface documentation and consistency — signature agreement, example quoting, return shapes in `$help`, stack-trace trimming
  - [x] US-1360: Malformed-input acceptance run and the regression suite it leaves behind

## EPIC-090 - Consolidation: the call-only manifest, the two-model gate, and the deletion of thirty-two tools

Completed 2026-09-06. [Epic document](EPIC-090.md). Epic 7 of 7 - the last - in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md), and the only one whose main
deliverable was subtraction.

**Persephone's MCP manifest went from 34 tools to 2**: `call`, and `execute_tool`. With
`PERSEPHONE_MCP_CALL_ONLY` set it is 1 - `call` alone, which is the end state the roadmap set out
to reach. All 13 guide resources remain, reachable by URI; only the `read_guide` *tool* went,
because a resource costs an agent nothing until it reads one while a tool costs a slot in every
session's manifest.

**Nothing was deleted on the strength of a table.** Thirty of the tools carried a retirable marking
from epics 085-089; this epic added replacements for the last two (`execute_script` becomes
`script.execute(code)`, `read_guide` becomes resources plus `$help`), then put all 32 in front of a
gate: ten scenarios covering every deleted capability, each starting from `call` with **no path**,
run twice - Haiku through `mcp-test-agent-call`, and Codex against the genuinely reduced manifest.
No scenario failed. Two PARTIALs, both fixed and the affected surface re-run
([run log](../../qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-090-deletion-gate.md)).

**Two tools survive and both survive honestly.** `call` is the endpoint. `execute_tool` stays
because its replacement `tools.execute` could not be proved without a human running one real tool -
every registered toolset on this machine calls a live service with the user's credentials, and
registering a scratch one needs a click on a trust dialog an agent must not take on its own behalf.
Principle 3 - *retire nothing until its replacement passes the same test* - held to the last row.

**Follow-up, 2026-09-07 (US-1353): the last row closed and the count is 34 → 1.** The user ran a
real tool through `tools.execute` against a registered toolset in a user project and all three
capability rows checked out, so `execute_tool` was marked retirable and deleted, and the
`PERSEPHONE_MCP_CALL_ONLY` flag went with it exactly as decision 2 anticipated. `call` is the whole
manifest, with no flag needed to make it so.

**`open_window` came within one investigation of joining it.** No closed window could be produced to
reopen, and only reading `windowOnClose` revealed why: a closed window is retained solely when one
of its pages is modified or pinned. Pinning a page made the test possible and the row passed on its
own merit. That is the difference between a gate and a formality.

**The flag is an environment variable, not a setting**, and deliberately so: EPIC-089 had spent a
whole task one day earlier deleting `mcp.browser-tools.enabled` and its eight files of plumbing
because a switch that trims the manifest reads to a user as a privacy control and is not one. Adding
a second of that shape immediately afterwards would have been incoherent. Ten lines in one file, off
by construction.

**What the gate was actually worth.** Five defects it alone would have caught. Three fixed inside
it: `page.editor.url` went stale after an in-page navigation, so an agent clicked a link, read the
old URL and reported to the user that the click had done nothing; `pressKey`'s summary never said it
performs no browser default action; and the Log View help claimed CSV grids without naming the
`contentType` discriminator, so an agent concluded they did not exist. Two left alone on purpose,
because the deleted tool and its replacement behave identically and the replacement is therefore
faithful: `networkRequests()` returns empty for browser pages, and `back()` does not return after a
link-click navigation.

**And one that had nothing to do with this roadmap.** The main-process Vite build was never marked
as a Node build, so every `process.env` compiled to `{}` - nineteen dead reads in the shipped
bundle, including `command-runner`'s `env: { ...process.env }`, which had been starting every Agent
Tool and board-backend child process with the parent environment stripped, PATH included. It
surfaced only because the call-only flag refused to turn on and the reason had to be chased into the
bundle (US-1352).

Three standalone fixes came out of the epic besides: US-1350 (the MCP Inspector's result editor
never filled its RESULT panel), US-1351 (`call helpSearch(...)` opened the MCP Log page as a side
effect of a *search*, because `helpSearch` walks every `node: true` member and `pages.logView`'s
getter created the page), and US-1352 above.

## EPIC-089 - The browser and the app window through `call`, and the retirement of fifteen tools

Completed 2026-09-06. [Epic document](EPIC-089.md). Epic 6 of 7 in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md). All fifteen of its tools are now
**retirable** - the fourteen `browser_*` tools and `open_url` - and one setting was actually
**deleted**, which no previous epic in this programme did. Nothing else was removed; EPIC-090 does
that behind the call-only flag.

**Every surface epic before this one was construction; this one was parity.** The automation layer
already existed and was good: a Playwright-compatible command set over one adapter interface, with
three implementations already driving a browser page, a board frame and Persephone's own window, plus
merged iframe snapshots, a two-phase navigation wait, a documented Electron text-input workaround and
a privacy guard. `pages[i].editor` on a browser page already returned a hand-written 29-member
descriptor. What was missing was narrower and sharper than the roadmap's one-line entry implied:
**only one of the three hosts was reachable from `call`, and the one that was could not use the refs
its own snapshot produced.** The facade's interaction members were selector-only, so an agent that
took a snapshot was handed addresses it had no way to spend.

**The epic corrected its own plan four times before writing code**, each time by checking the source
rather than the table. There are **fourteen** `browser_*` tools, not fifteen - the fifteenth retired
here is `open_url`. The app-window node is **`window.screen`**, not `window.ui`, because the root
already has a `ui` node and a second one a level down meaning "the raw DOM of this window" would make
the root hint ambiguous exactly where an agent chooses between them. **HTML pages get no facade**:
their previews are iframes inside Persephone's own webContents, which the app-window snapshot already
merges, so a fourth target would have been a second way to do the same thing with its own bugs. And
`open_url`'s replacement is `pages.openUrlInBrowserTab`, with `pages.openUrl` added *beside* it as the
pipeline-routed opener - renaming the browser-only member would have promised routing it does not do.

**The design task the epic was scheduled last for turned out to be small and real.** `ref.ts` kept one
module-level frame-index map, so `f1-e456` meant "the first iframe of whichever host was snapshotted
most recently" - a ref could resolve in the wrong CDP session and act on the wrong document. Main-frame
refs were already per-session; only that map was global. It is now keyed by CDP registration key,
which is exact for a browser tab, a board frame and the app-window sentinel.

**Two `call`-wide capabilities came out of a surface epic again**, as `MAX_DEPTH` and the absent-key
rule did in EPIC-088. `call` can now return a real **MCP image block**, without which `screenshot()`
would have handed back base64 inside JSON - truncated by `maxLength`, invisible to the model - and
`browser_take_screenshot` could not have been marked. And `pages.showPage` now **refuses an unknown
page id** instead of silently leaving the previous page active; that was found because
`window.screen`'s privacy refusal tells the agent to recover with exactly that call, and the advice
would have looped forever on a typo.

**The surfaces caught two live bugs on their first run, which is what the QA files were promised to
do.** The browser `elements` list reported `toolbar-tor-info` as visible on a non-Tor page - and it
was right: `IconButtonView` dropped the `hidden` prop on `update()`, so a "Tor connection info"
button rendered on every browser page (US-1341). And a board secondary frame that had loaded and then
been collapsed answered CDP with an **empty** accessibility tree, so `snapshot({ tabId })` returned
`""` while reporting success - a silent empty, and a pre-existing hole that contradicted the gate's
own doc comment. Both were found by using the surface, not by reading the code.

**The privacy rule was the epic's most likely regression and was verified rather than argued.**
`window.screen` refuses while the active page is incognito or Tor, because a whole-window snapshot
would carry that page's content. It was tested against a real Tor page the user had open: refused,
then allowed after activating a normal page, with no reload. Its `summarize()` deliberately carries
host identity only, because the resolver's walk ends before a node's own `restricted()` runs when the
node itself is the last segment.

**The deleted setting is the epic's most user-visible act, and it was a correction, not a loosening.**
`mcp.browser-tools.enabled` claimed to control whether an agent could drive the browser, boards and
Persephone's own window. It never did: neither `call` nor `execute_script` passes through the gate it
sat on, so the browser facade's `snapshot()` and `click()` had worked with it off since `call`
shipped. The real boundary is `agent-access.ts`, untouched here. Until EPIC-090 deletes them the
fourteen tools now appear in every manifest by default - a context cost, recorded rather than hidden.

**Acceptance:** a Haiku agent with `call` alone and no guides opened a page, read it, clicked a link
and listed the tabs in thirteen calls with one recoverable wrong turn, and never looked for a setting
to enable
([qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-089-browser-surfaces.md](../../qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-089-browser-surfaces.md)).
Its one instructive failure: it had refs in the snapshot it had just read and still spent a separate
`evaluate()` call plus a hand-written CSS selector to click a link. The capability was discoverable
and not reached, so `snapshot`'s summary now says what refs *replace*, not merely that they exist.

**Needs user check:** whether `waitForNavigation()` should adopt the tool path's two-phase wait (one
implementation, at the cost of latency and a behaviour change for existing scripts) or stay a
document-load wait with `waitFor` as the navigation remedy - documentation was changed, timing was
not. EPIC-088's withheld `execute_tool` marking is still outstanding and unaffected.

## EPIC-088 - Boards and tools through `call`, and the retirement of seven tools

Completed 2026-09-06. [Epic document](EPIC-088.md). Epic 5 of 7 in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md). Six of its seven tools are now
**retirable**; `execute_tool` is deliberately **not**, and that withholding is the most interesting
thing in the epic. Nothing was deleted; EPIC-090 does that behind the call-only flag.

**Where the previous epics exposed state, this one exposed action.** EPIC-086 and EPIC-087 described
what was on screen and what the user could read. Here most of the surface is something an agent can
*do* - create a board, register a toolset, run a tool, reindex a knowledge root - and every one of
those has a trust boundary attached. The descriptor work was the easy half; the hard half was making
sure no path could grant a privilege that today requires a user's click. It cannot: nothing trusts a
board, nothing registers a toolset, and `createToolset` raises the user's own dialog through the
attention protocol and reports the declined branch honestly.

**The epic corrected its own plan three times before writing code**, each time because the roadmap's
one-line entry disagreed with the source. The root name is `tools`, not `toolsets`, because
`ai-vision/root.ts` had reserved exactly that name since EPIC-083. `board_refresh` became
`pages[i].editor.reload()` rather than `boards.refresh()`, because the tool is page-scoped in every
detail and a namespace member would have had to invent "which board". And `create_board` /
`open_board` turned out to be **already answered** by existing `boards` members - what the namespace
actually lacked was *enumeration*, since all fourteen of its members took a root path and nothing
could produce one. `boards.list()` is the real content of that retirement.

**Two defects were found that no build could have caught**, both in the shared `call` machinery
rather than in any descriptor, and both now standing rules for the rest of the roadmap:

- **A key set to `undefined` reaches an agent as `null`.** The first `boards.list()` run returned
  `installed: null` and `name: null` - exactly the falsy stand-in decision 9 forbids. Absent
  optionals must be *omitted*, not assigned.
- **`MAX_DEPTH` in the result shaper was 4**, which truncated every tool's `inputSchema` to
  `{ note: "depth limit" }`. An agent could read a tool's description but not learn how to call it,
  making the replacement strictly worse than the `search_tools` it replaces. Raised to 8.

**The acceptance run passed with no wrong turns** - the first surface epic to manage that. A Haiku
agent with `call` alone and no guides listed the machine's boards, opened one, reloaded it, and read
a tool's full argument list, discovering `boards` and `tools` from the root hint alone
([qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-088-boards-and-tools.md](../../qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-088-boards-and-tools.md)).
It never used `tools.search()`, reaching the arguments through the toolset collection instead -
worth remembering at EPIC-090, because an agent asked about tools reaches for a *list* first.

**`execute_tool` stayed unmarked because the honest test could not be run.** Its rows need a tool
that actually executes, and every registered toolset on this machine calls a live company service
with the user's credentials; the alternative, registering a scratch toolset, needs a click on the
"Register this toolset?" dialog. That click was not taken - an agent answering its own trust prompt
would defeat the property the epic exists to protect, and a marking bought that way would be
worthless. One user call finishes it; the reproduction is in the epic's Needs user check.

The epic also **closed a pre-existing privilege hole**: `command` and `args` were writable on the
MCP Inspector facade, so an agent could set a command line of its own choosing and call `connect()`,
spawning a process with the user's privileges and no dialog. Both setters are gone.

And it **added surfaces that replace no tool**: facades for the board page, Board Info, the toolset
editor, the Tools hub, and Mneme config and root - none of which had one - the panel state the MCP
Inspector facade never reported, and the two page openers (`pages.showToolsHubPage`,
`pages.showMnemeConfigPage`) that existed on the model but had never been declared, so an agent
could not open either screen.

| Task | Title |
|------|-------|
| US-1325 | The board page surface - trust states, toolbar, secondary views, and `reload()` |
| US-1326 | The `boards` node completes - enumeration of installed, trusted and open boards |
| US-1327 | The Board Info surface - install, version, and the board-vars question |
| US-1328 | The `tools` root node - search, execute, toolsets, refresh, registration prompt |
| US-1329 | The toolset editor and the Tools hub |
| US-1330 | The MCP Inspector surface - elements, panels, and the removed stdio setters |
| US-1331 | Mneme config and Mneme root |
| US-1332 | Acceptance run on Haiku; the two `qa/surfaces/` files; six tools marked retirable |

## EPIC-087 - The data editors through `call`, and the retirement of `ui_push`

Completed 2026-09-06. [Epic document](EPIC-087.md). Epic 4 of 7 in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md). `ui_push` is now **retirable** -
every capability exercised live through `call` first - but nothing was deleted; EPIC-090 does that
behind the call-only flag.

**Where EPIC-086 annotated, this epic built.** That epic inherited thirteen facade classes and
mostly added `elements` to them. Here six of the eight surfaces had no facade at all: a REST page,
an env-vars page, an archive, a Folder View and a Git Tree all answered `pages[i].editor` with an id,
a name, and nothing an agent could act on. Grid and notebook had facades with no `elements`. So the
epic is mostly new surface area: eight facades, curated page-scoped element lists for each, and
individual sidebar panel nodes under `page.panels`, which previously reported that a panel was open
and nothing whatever about its contents.

**The headline was `ui_push`, and it is the one replacement that deliberately behaves differently
from the tool it replaces.** `ui_push` blocks until every dialog it raised is answered.
`pages.logView.push` returns immediately with the dialog ids, raises `attention` while an answer is
outstanding, and hands the answer back through `dialogResult(id)`. That is not a shortcut taken for
convenience: Log View dialogs are inline *page entries*, so the `pending` + `dialogs[0]` mechanism
that rescues every other blocking call in the app cannot reach them, and giving `call` an infinite
timeout for one path would wreck error reporting for the other thirty. Both paths exist side by side
until EPIC-090, which is when the change gets its second opinion.

**One design decision was written wrong and had to be rewritten mid-epic.** Decision 7 originally
said secrets are never returned - names and presence only, values as a redaction marker. Verifying
that against the REST client killed it: `rest-client` is a content-host editor, so `pages[i].content`
already returns the raw `.rest.json` with its URL tokens, `Authorization` values and body, one path
segment away on the same node. A facade redacting those fields would have protected nothing while
telling the agent and the user's `$help` that a protection existed - a stated guarantee the system
does not honour, which is the same error EPIC-086 caught in the `open_url` premise and refused to
ship. The decision now separates the two halves, which are not symmetric: *accepting* a secret is
always forbidden, because an argument is written into the MCP transcript where the secret was not
before; *returning* one is only a boundary where a boundary actually exists. US-1321 then asked that
question again, separately, for env vars and archives - and got different answers, which is the point.

**Three defects were caught only by running the app**, and each would have passed a green build:
UIKit views *delete* `data-name` when a later `update()` omits the `name` prop, so three declared
controls were named on mount and stripped on the first re-render; the highlight overlay rings only
the first match unless `all: true` is passed, so six controls promising "once per note" would have
rung one arbitrary note; and an archive click handler was *reimplemented* rather than moved, taking
the directory branch for every item and dropping a selection update.

**The acceptance run produced two more, neither of them descriptor work.** `call` could not assign
JSON text at all - MCP clients parse `value` as JSON, so the error message's advice to "stringify
first" was impossible to follow, and any agent trying to fill a JSON grid page was in a dead end.
And `pages.logView.push` silently accepted a *guessed* entry type, rendering a blank entry and
returning an id, so the agent reported success while the user saw nothing. The first run also showed
why the channel was unfindable: it described itself as "the get-or-created MCP Log View writer and
dialog read-back surface", which is true and says nothing about what it is for. Reworded to lead with
purpose and pointed at from the root node - and run 3's agent named that hint as the reason it
succeeded. Log: [qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-087-data-surfaces.md](../../qa/runs/2026-09-06-epic-087-data-surfaces.md).

**Needs user check** (two items, both recorded in the epic document with reproductions): the REST /
env-vars page-level secret boundary, which would have to cover `content` and the facade together and
is the user's decision to make; and a pre-existing `pages.openFile()` bug where a directory path
leaves a ghost "Empty" page that the tab strip renders but the object model does not contain.

## EPIC-086 — The page node redesign, and the text-and-preview editor family through `call`

Completed 2026-09-06. [Epic document](EPIC-086.md). Epic 3 of 7 in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md). `create_page`, `get_page_content`
and `set_page_content` are now **retirable** — every path exercised live through `call` first — but
nothing was deleted; EPIC-090 does that behind the call-only flag.

**The epic began by changing the shape of the page node, and that was the right call.** `pages[i]`
carried thirteen `as*()` methods, the fossil of a single-text-host architecture Persephone no longer
has: the page's main model *is* the editor model now, so `asGrid()` was a redundant segment in front
of the thing the agent wanted. US-1310 replaced it with `page.editor` as the current facade, a
discriminated union on `id`, plus `editorSwitches`, `tab` and `panels` — the structure a user would
name if asked to describe a page. There were no scripts to protect, so nothing was kept for
compatibility, and the release became **5.0.0** to say so.

**Three surfaces had no facade at all.** Video and file diff were real editors `PageWrapper` never
mapped, and compare is not an editor but a *mode* over a pair of pages. Video and file diff got
ordinary facades; compare went to `pages.compare`, where a property of a pair belongs. All three
now answer the questions the epic set them: what is playing, which revisions this diff is between,
which pages are being compared.

**The recurring defect across all seven tasks was silent success, and it had five faces.** A getter
returning `false` for "no host attached", which asserts "not encrypted". A getter returning `""`
for "I cannot see the document", indistinguishable from an empty document. `enterCompareMode`
returning a bare `false` for two unrelated causes, so an agent could not tell "group these first"
from "these cannot be compared". Editor actions hitting an `else { return; }` and resolving as
though they had worked. And an `elements` list that would have declared selectors for canvas-drawn
graph nodes and for DOM inside a sandboxed iframe — controls that can never be found, reported with
`found: true`. Every one was caught in plan review or `/review` and fixed; the rule that came out of
it is uniform across the family: **state getters return `undefined` when their backing model or view
is not attached, and actions throw a diagnostic naming the missing precondition.**

**The plan reviews paid for themselves in every task.** Five plans, five defects that would have
shipped, including a fabricated code snippet citing a `FACADE_FOR_EDITOR` key (`"text-editor"`) that
does not exist, and a live-media bridge built on a `data-part` DOM query — which would have worked,
and then failed silently the first time a view was refactored. It was replaced with the repository's
own view-to-model handoff pattern (`setMediaElement`, after `setContainer` and
`setEditorOverlayRef`), which deleted the format branch and the page-scoping question along with it.

**Two corrections were made to documents above this epic.** The editor-family table's control counts
were first-pass estimates — image was 9 and is 3, video was 14 and is 10 — because structural roots,
status labels, transient menu roots and generated native media controls are evidence of a render
tree, not curated controls. And the roadmap said this epic retires "`open_url` for non-browser
targets"; it has **no** non-browser branch, so there was nothing here to replace and the tool moved
wholly to EPIC-089. Principle 3 is the only reason that did not ship as a promise.

**Left for the user** — six items in the epic document's *Needs user check* section, none blocking.
The most consequential: `strictNullChecks` is off, so the epic's central invariant is unenforceable
by the compiler and rests on review discipline. One facade had already drifted (`html` declared
`string`, returned `string | undefined`, `.d.ts` said `html?: string`, all green).

**Acceptance:** Haiku with `call` as its only tool passed the epic's scenario with two markdown
pages open — enumerated the page's capabilities from `page.editor`, and rang the correct page's
control. One finding acted on: the markdown `$help` never said the preview re-renders automatically,
so the agent spent two `helpSearch` calls hunting a refresh control that does not exist.

## EPIC-085 — The application shell through `call`: windows, Menu Bar, sidebar panels, Settings

Completed 2026-09-05. [Epic document](EPIC-085.md). Epic 2 of 7 in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md). `get_app_info`, `list_windows` and
`open_window` are now **retirable** — every field and action has a verified path — but nothing was
deleted; EPIC-090 does that behind the call-only flag.

**Smaller than the roadmap made it look, and the scope check is why.** Before writing the epic,
`pages` turned out to already carry every tab-strip action a user has, and `WindowNode` already
covered most of `list_windows`. So the tab strip got QA coverage rather than new API, US-1303
became largely a parity *audit*, and the epic's real work was the three surfaces that were
genuinely invisible to an agent: the Menu Bar (`window.menuBar`), the per-page sidebar
(`page.panels`), and the Settings page (the `settings` catalog plus `settings.highlight(key)`).

**`get_app_info`'s nine fields were redistributed, not rehomed.** Each now lives beside the thing
it describes — `settings.browserProfiles`, `main.runtime.resourcesDir`/`demoBoardDir`,
`boards.assetsBaseUrl`/`manifestUrl` — with cross-references from where an agent actually meets the
question (profile names from `showBrowserPage`, the demo template from `createDemoBoard`). No
`appInfo` bag node exists, deliberately.

**Three of the epic's own design decisions were overturned by evidence, and amended in place.**
Decision 6 specified a `pages[i].asSettings()` facade — wrong, because an agent asked "where do I
change X" does not have the Settings page open, so the catalog moved to the always-reachable
`settings` node. Decision 5 specified `close(panelId)` — cut, because the user's own close differs
by registration pattern (`ArchiveSecondaryView.onCloseClick` disposes via `removeSecondaryView`),
so one uniform close would produce a state no user gesture produces. Decision 7 assigned the
page-area selectors to `window.elements`; the sidebar ones went to `page.panels`, whose state is
what explains their presence — which is what the decision itself says to do.

**The epic's theme was silent success, found five different ways.** A `menuBar.open("Recent Files")`
that would have accepted a label and changed nothing (plan review). A `toggleNavigator()` whose
second branch constructs an `ExplorerEditor` and whose third silently no-ops (caught by verifying a
citation instead of accepting it). A `page.panels.toggleSidebar()` that returned success while
`PageModel`'s mandatory-open clamp rewrote `open: false` back to `true` (live testing). A
`settings.highlight(key)` that would have reported `found: true` and drawn nothing, because
`settings.css` gives section roots `display: contents` and the overlay only rings an element with a
client rectangle (caught by reading the overlay's hit-testing — the only one nobody had to hit at
runtime).

And the fifth, which took the app down. Asked only **where** the MCP server is turned off, the
Haiku acceptance agent found the control the intended way in three calls, highlighted it correctly,
then called `settings.set("mcp.enabled", false)` — disabling the server it was talking through.
Recovery needed a hand-edit of `appSettings.json`, because once MCP is off there is no route back
in through MCP. `settings.set` now **refuses** the self-severing keys when reached through `call`
(`app.settings.set` is untouched, so the user's scripts and the Settings page still work), and its
summary states the constraint in situational words. The generic `caution` had been there all along
and did not stop it.

Two rules for the four surface epics that follow, both recorded in
[`qa/surfaces/shell.md`](../../qa/surfaces/shell.md): **a `found: true` is not proof a highlight was
visible**, and **a `caution` is not a guard** — where an action is irreversible from the agent's
side, refuse it and say what to do instead.

**Acceptance, all on Haiku with `call` as its only tool.** "What panels does this page have, and how
many windows?" — four calls, no wrong turns. "Open the Menu Bar and tell me what's in it" — all 19
folders actually present, not a hardcoded four. "Where do I turn off the MCP server?" — correct
answer in three calls, and the restraint failure above. QA lives in
[`qa/surfaces/shell.md`](../../qa/surfaces/shell.md) (tests S.7-S.19) and the new
[`qa/surfaces/windows.md`](../../qa/surfaces/windows.md); W.2-W.6 there are written but unrun, as
they need a second and a closed window.

`/review` found one real defect after implementation: prototype-chain key lookup in the two settings
record maps, so `settings.set("constructor", …)` would have tripped the self-severing refusal.
Fixed with own-property checks and verified live.

## EPIC-084 — Agent transparency infrastructure: attention, `dialogs`, `menus`, elements/highlight

Completed 2026-09-05. [Epic document](EPIC-084.md). Epic 1 of 7 in the
[agent transparency roadmap](../agent-transparency-roadmap.md). Additive throughout — no tool was
retired; the roadmap's final epic does that.

**The defect that motivated it is gone.** An agent that called `pages.closePage` on a modified page
used to stall until the renderer bridge timed out, and recovered only through
`browser_snapshot` + `browser_click` on `pageId: "app"`. Now the call returns
`{ pending: true, attention }` naming the dialog and the path to each button, the action stays
alive, and `dialogs[0].click("Don't Save")` finishes it. Attention rides on *every* result — errors
and unrelated reads included — and is deliberately not gated by `hints: "never"`, because it is
state the agent cannot otherwise know.

**Two plan errors caught in review, both structural.** US-1300's first design threaded a renderer
*runtime* through `resolveCall`, which every present and future caller would have had to pass;
replaced by a descriptor-owned `provide(name)` hook — one line in the resolver, four files off the
change list, and `app.call()` gets the protocol for free. US-1301 assumed a native modal stops the
renderer replying; it does not (async pickers are window-modal), so native attention rides an
ordinary result and `pending` is reserved for the bridge-timeout branch. The two *synchronous*
native dialogs block main's event loop and are unreportable by construction — documented, not
worked around.

**Both acceptance criteria passed on Haiku with `call` as its only tool, and the runs were worth
more than the passes.** Two product changes came out of watching them:

- *Put the constraint before the call to action.* Told only "close the active page", the agent
  answered Unsaved Changes with "Don't Save" and discarded the user's work. The same caution placed
  *below* the `Resolve it with …` line changed nothing on a re-run — the model acts on the first
  actionable line it reads. Moved *above* it, the next run stopped and asked the user.
- *Cross-reference beats redirection.* "Show me where to change the tab language" returned
  `page.language` three runs running. Indexing element purposes in `helpSearch`, rewriting the root
  `ui` summary, and adding a root `$help` path all failed — the agent never called `helpSearch` and
  never re-read the root. A pointer on `page.language` itself, the node it lands on every time,
  fixed it in one run. `page.language` was never a wrong answer.

**`/review` found a fourteenth dialog.** `EditLinkDialog` also enters `dialogsState`, so US-1298's
inventory of 13 was incomplete. The instance was one adapter; the *class* of failure was worse and
was fixed separately — `getAdapter` threw on an unregistered `viewId`, so one missed registration
broke `dialogs[i]`, `children()` and attention for every open dialog at once. It now degrades to an
`UnknownDialog` that can still be dismissed and reflects over nothing, since an unknown dialog may
be holding a credential.

**The privacy rule holds.** `PasswordDialog` exposes only `buttons`, `click`, `cancel`; `value` and
`password` are rejected as non-members and `$help` discloses nothing further.

Also started here: [`qa/surfaces/`](../../qa/surfaces/README.md), QA grouped by screen/editor rather
than by tool, doubling as UI regression — `dialogs.md`, `shell.md`, `menus.md`, each carrying its
run findings.

## EPIC-083 — AiVision: one self-discoverable MCP tool over the app object model

Completed 2026-09-05. [Epic document](EPIC-083.md). One MCP tool, `call`, takes a **path** into the
live object model (the empty path, `pages[2].content`, `pages[0].asGrid().addRows`, `windows[1].pages`,
`main.runtime`) and returns the value **plus a hint** describing what it landed on. No second object
tree was built: the tree *is* the existing `AppWrapper` → `PageCollectionWrapper` → `PageWrapper` →
facade graph, and AiVision is metadata hung on those same objects through one interface
(`src/shared/ai-vision/types.ts`), shared by both processes.

**The epic's own acceptance test passed.** US-1293 ran the same four-part scenario twice on haiku:
with `call` alone (no guides, no other tool) it completed 4/4 in 14 calls, discovering everything
from the empty path, hints, `helpSearch` and `$help` — no guessing, no errors. With the full ~25-tool
set it completed 4/4 in 9 calls but produced the run's only **wrong** answer, reading the theme from
a fixed tool's payload (`system`) instead of the live setting (`default-dark`). Recommendation
recorded: **go** for the consolidation epic, conditional on no tool being retired until its
replacement path passes the same test, `browser_*` getting its ref-lifecycle design first, and
removal going through a deprecation period. Log: `qa/runs/2026-09-05-epic-083-call-vs-tools.md`.

**Discovery is cooperative, and that is the load-bearing decision.** The tree is dynamic — pages
open and close, a page's facade depends on its current editor — but the resolver must never probe
getters, because `PageWrapper.grouped` *creates* the grouped page when read. So every node answers
for itself: `members` is the static kind-level shape (deduped per MCP session), `children()` is what
exists right now, and `restricted()` closes a node instance-by-instance. Nothing enumerates by
reflection.

**Four review findings changed the work, each caught against the source rather than the plan:**

- `helpSearch` was to follow every uncautioned property. `Page.content` holds a whole file, and the
  safety guarantee would have rested on authors remembering `caution` on future side-effecting
  getters. Replaced with an explicit opt-in, `IAiMember.node`. Implementation then hit the
  complement: the root's `fs`/`shell`/`proc` carry `caution` and would have become unreachable —
  resolved by separating the two ideas, `node: true` = *reading this is safe*, `caution` = *what its
  members do*.
- US-1295 wanted a final-node `restricted()` check in the shared resolver so `main.script` would
  answer with its refusal. That would have broken design decision 7: a user's private browser page
  must stay **summarisable** at `pages[i]` while everything under it is refused. The gate is
  reported through `summarize()` instead; the resolver is untouched.
- `main.*` was trimmed of everything the renderer tree already exposes (`main.downloads` read-only,
  `main.boards.published` dropped, `main.version` merged into `main.runtime`). Two paths to one
  action is exactly the confusion this epic exists to remove.
- US-1296's board transport shrank by two thirds: main already holds the board's `hostWebContents`,
  so a `WebContents` → window-index lookup feeds the existing `sendToRenderer`; and
  `pagesModel.findPage(id)` already matches **any editor id**, so the hosting page is found from the
  `ownerId` main already stores — no IPC signature change at all.

**Privacy got a better design than the one first asked for.** The user's initial idea was a dev-only
constant letting the agent see incognito/Tor pages for testing; it was replaced before commit by a
provenance rule that also holds in release: `openedByAgent` marks pages an MCP tool or MCP-run script
opened, and only those are readable. The flag is never persisted (a restored page is the user's
again), an agent-opened private page's tab reads "Browser (agent)", and an agent asking for an
incognito tab never joins the user's own. One helper, `editors/browser/agent-access.ts`, is consulted
by browser targeting, MCP page summaries and `Page.restricted()` alike. A board reaching the tree
through `persephone.call` inherits the same guard.

**Verified live, not asserted:** root/`pages`/`$help`/unknown-member self-correction/`value`
assignment/`maxLength`; every facade including `asGrid(true)` switching editors; all twelve `app`
namespaces (`fs.exists`, `shell.version.runtimeVersions()`, `ui.log` correctly refused with the
member list); `main.runtime`, `main.mcp.sessions`, `main.script.execute` capturing `console.log` and
returning `isError` for a throw instead of escaping to the unhandled-rejection path, the settings
gate in **both** states, and `windows[0].main` rejected with guidance; `app.call` in a script bound
to a non-active page returning *its own* page; and the regex board reading `page.grouped.content`,
matching, and writing back — with page affinity proven while the board's page was **inactive**, via
a timer-triggered call that still resolved to its own host's neighbour.

**US-1294 (generating descriptors from `.d.ts` JSDoc) was declined**, reversibly. Hand-writing them
produced precisely what typings cannot express and what makes the hints work — "reading it CREATES a
grouped page", `node: true`, `restricted()`, the deliberate omissions (`downloads.init` as internal,
`ui.log` belonging to a different `ui`), and prose `help`. A generator would be overridden at nearly
every interesting member, and co-location already handles the drift it would guard against.

**Not verifiable without the user**, and recorded as such: trust revocation while a board is mounted
(untrusting unmounts the webview, so the guard is verified by inspection), the Settings checkbox
wording and placement, packaged-build gate defaults, and the uninterruptible synchronous-loop warning
for `main.script`. Reviewed at epic level — `/review` PASS with no architecture findings; `/document`
and `/userdoc` updated the AiVision architecture, scripting boundaries, key-file index, board guides
and the user-facing API/scripting/settings docs.

- **EPIC-083** — [AiVision: a single self-discoverable MCP tool over the app object model](epics/EPIC-083.md) — completed 2026-09-05.
  One `call` tool taking a path into the live `app`/`pages`/facade tree and returning the value plus
  a hint; descriptors are an interface implemented by the existing script wrappers, not a second
  tree. Nothing was removed — the consolidation epic does that, gated on US-1293's evidence.

## EPIC-081 — DOM & IO mechanisms

Completed 2026-09-02. [Epic document](EPIC-081.md). The **final** epic of the
[De-React second-pass roadmap](../de-react-refactoring-2.md) — packages 6 + 7, and the one epic that
needed neither of the other two. Two mechanisms replaced two families of hand-rolled workarounds:
**two owner-bound layout primitives** (`schedule.firstLayout` / `schedule.settledLayout`) retiring a
triplicated `ResizeObserver` probe and two unbounded measurement retries, and **`createEchoGuard()`**
replacing three copies of an arm-and-hope `skipNext*` flag. Net effect on the source: 17 files
changed and 1 added, and every adopter shrank.

**The epic's abort criterion fired at plan time, and that was the whole value of writing one.**
US-1275 reported all three `ResizeObserver` adopters as wanting *settled* layout, not *first*. It
held up: the probe's `clearTimeout` resets on **every** resize observation, so the 200 ms timer fires
after the *last* one — settled semantics by construction — and both link panels sit inside
`CollapsiblePanelStack`, which animates `transition: flex 0.15s ease`. A first-rect measurement would
have frozen a 50 % split computed mid-animation at three sites. Resolution: **two named primitives**
rather than one with a mode flag, because a `quietMs = 0` default would hand "first" semantics to
precisely the kind of caller this finding was about.

**Seven of the roadmap's claims did not survive verification** — see the epic document's *Corrections
to the report's plan*. Four changed the work:

- P4's helper shape was wrong: a free function returning a cancel handle re-creates the manual handle
  field EPIC-080's US-1263 retired across 21 rAF sites, so both primitives are owner-bound methods;
- `BoardTargetModel` is not a layout probe at all — it polls a plain `Set<string>`, so neither
  `afterFirstLayout` nor a state subscription applied;
- the three 100–200 ms focus delays are a **focus-ordering** problem, not a layout one → backlog;
- §2.4 and §2.5 were **unassigned to any Part 5 package**, the same gap EPIC-082 found for §1.5/§1.8.

Investigation then made the epic *smaller* twice, both verified: `kickTransition` was **never built**
— `BookmarksDrawer`'s 10 ms timer set a `data-open` flag with **no consumer anywhere**, leaving
`MenuBarView` as the only genuine adopter, so the flush is inlined rather than abstracted for one
call site; and US-1278's waiter **already existed** one file away (`BoardEditorModel.waitForFrameLoad`),
so that file needed no change at all.

**One risk was closed by measurement rather than caveat.** US-1279 trades a boolean flag for exact
content matching, and the failure mode is asymmetric: a token that never matches would make *every*
settings save echo-reload. Static reading could not settle it (the read path does heuristic encoding
detection), so the `saveDataFile` → `getDataFile` round-trip was measured in the running app across
seven payloads. Six are byte-identical, including the real settings shape, CRLF, and full Unicode;
only a leading BOM diverges, and neither adopter produces one. BOM-stripping was deliberately **not**
added to the guard, because `TextHostEditorModel` passes document content where a BOM can be
legitimate.

**Two defects were caught in implementation review**, both a primitive applied to a site that was
never a layout probe:

- `MarkdownBodyView`'s anchor retry waits for *content still rendering*, not for container layout —
  and its container is already laid out, so `firstLayout` fired immediately and burned all ten
  attempts without a paint, silently breaking anchor navigation. **Reverted to `schedule.raf`** and
  recorded as deliberately unconverted; a real fix needs a render-complete signal from `typedQueue`.
- `ImageViewportView`'s synchronous `complete` check needed a `root.clientWidth > 0` guard at both
  call sites: `onImageLoad` fits against `getContainerBounds()`, and both a fresh mount and an
  open-but-inactive page measure 0x0.

**Verification: all 14 ledger rows verified by the user, no issues** — including the five needing a
human, and B2, the row that proves the arm-and-hope bug is genuinely fixed rather than relocated.
Reviewed at epic level — `/review` PASS with no new findings; `/userdoc` correctly changed nothing,
as the epic is internal mechanism with no user-facing surface. The two new scheduling primitives and
the echo-guard contract are now documented in `state-management.md`.

- **EPIC-081** — [DOM & IO mechanisms](epics/EPIC-081.md) — completed 2026-09-02.

## EPIC-082 — React architecture removal at the call sites

Completed 2026-09-01. [Epic document](EPIC-082.md). The second epic of the
[De-React second-pass roadmap](../de-react-refactoring-2.md) — packages 4 + 5. EPIC-080 built the
mechanisms; this epic spent them, removing React's *architecture* from the places where it survived
as a shape rather than a dependency. Zero `queueMicrotask` and zero `DepsGate` remain in the graph
and rest-client de-effecting targets, the `tree-provider` island's false deferrals are gone, and the
items render-prop is a caller-supplied `itemsView(host, initialProps)` factory.

**Six of the roadmap's claims did not survive verification**, and four of them would have caused a
regression if implemented as written — see the epic document's *Corrections to the report's plan*:

- the render-prop's stated cost (fresh closures per update) was false; the callbacks were stable
  bound fields and the real defect was **split ownership**;
- §1.5's "fresh string selector fires every dispatch" was false — `compareSelection` identity-compares
  **arrays** only, so the joined-key selector was correct and "fixing" it would have made the legend
  re-highlight on every property edit;
- `EnvVarsBodyView.scheduleApply` is a deliberate **coalescer** with a re-entry flag, not effect
  emulation — converting it would have reseeded the grid mid-mutation;
- the link-editor's three portal refs were dead, and so was the **entire** `LinkEditorProps` interface;
- §1.5's memo chains and §1.8's vocabulary residue were **unassigned to any package** in Part 5;
- `CategoryViewImpl.ts:102` was a wording fix, not a code fix.

Two design decisions worth carrying forward: `afterDispatch` runs **inline** when no dispatch is in
flight, so it is not a coalescer (now documented in `state-management.md`); and a caller-supplied
`(host, initialProps) => IOwnedView` factory is the way to move an ownership boundary **without**
moving an import boundary across layers (now in `component-guide.md`, alongside `PopoverView`'s
`contentView` seam).

**One unrelated defect found and fixed:** graph search results never displayed matched properties —
`SearchResultRowView.updatePropertyRow` read `row.children[2]` where an element-only collection makes
the value span index 1, so `highlightInto` threw on every property match. Confirmed pre-existing by
reverting to `HEAD` and reproducing.

**Four runtime verifications remain outstanding by user decision** (physical drag gestures, tree
selection adoption across six consumers, and the graph grids' apply path) — the epic document records
exactly which task owns each.

- **EPIC-082** — [React architecture removal at the call sites](epics/EPIC-082.md) — completed 2026-09-01.
  Packages 4 + 5 of the roadmap. Two independent strands; nothing here can brick the app, but every
  task changes behaviour a green build cannot catch, so each is verified in the running editor.

## EPIC-080 — State, lifetime & scheduling core

Completed 2026-09-01. [Epic document](EPIC-080.md). The first epic of the
[De-React second-pass roadmap](../de-react-refactoring-2.md). Built the four missing framework
mechanisms the renderer had been hand-rolling — one listener core, one disposal contract,
`afterDispatch`, and owner-bound scheduling — and fixed three real defects on the way: both
`EventChannel` unsubscribe bugs and `debounce`'s unstoppable `canRun` retry chain.

Four of the roadmap's own claims did not survive verification and were corrected in the epic
document: `DisposableCollection` was dead code rather than public API; `KeyedList` did not have the
problem attributed to it; `PageContentView` cannot adopt `SubtreeSwap` (it retires in the opposite
order to `afterDispatch`'s contract, and changing it would mean re-reviewing 55 call sites); and the
`live`/`generation` family is mostly load-bearing — only 45 of ~215 references were provably
redundant. Shrinking it further needs new owner mechanisms for async boundaries, not more sweeping.

- **EPIC-080** — [State, lifetime & scheduling core](EPIC-080.md) — completed 2026-09-01
  - [x] US-1259: P1 — one listener core behind `TOneState`/`Emitter`/`EventChannel`; **both** `EventChannel` unsubscribe bugs fixed; `dispose()` on emitters
  - [x] US-1260: P7 — `DisposableStore` takes `Cleanup | IDisposable` and gains `child()`; `DisposableCollection` deleted (zero consumers); helper ownership for `CellTooltip`/`ImperativeSplitter`
  - [x] US-1261: P2 — `core/state/dispatch.ts` (`afterDispatch`, module-global depth + FIFO drain); `checkEmptyPage` hoisted to its callers so the replacement page still follows teardown
  - [x] US-1262: P2 — `PageModel.deferEditorCleanup` → `afterDispatch`; timer bookkeeping deleted, **async cleanup drain preserved**
  - [x] US-1263: P3 — `OwnerScheduler` (`schedule.raf/timeout/delayer`) on `VanillaView`/`TModel`; 8 rAF sites converted; `debounce` gains `cancel()`
  - [x] US-1264: Retired the *provable* duplicates only — 14 `live` + 31 `inert`; 92 `live`, 35 `inert` and all generations deliberately retained
  - [x] US-1265: `InputDialogView` → `KeyedList`, `TreeProviderViewImpl` → `SubtreeSwap`; `PageContentView` deferred with reasons
  - [x] US-1266: 17 raw `addEventListener` sites → `VanillaView.listen()` (split out of US-1260)

## EPIC-079 — Retire `uikit/VirtualGrid` in favour of av-grid's `RenderGrid`

Completed 2026-08-30. [Epic document](EPIC-079.md). Persephone retired its forked virtualization
engine, migrated the UIKit primitives, components, and editors to av-grid 2.3.0, and removed
3,755 lines of duplicate engine code and exports.

- **EPIC-079** — [Retire `uikit/VirtualGrid` in favour of av-grid's `RenderGrid`](EPIC-079.md) — completed 2026-08-30
  - [x] US-1233: Decide the av-grid development loop — **done**: `npm link`, no manifest change
  - [x] US-1234: Add a keyed cell pool to av-grid (`setReuseKey`) — **done**, buckets not scan (88×)
  - [x] US-1236: Stop av-grid losing scroll position — **done**, both faces measured in Chromium
  - [x] US-1240: Add after-paint scrolling to av-grid — **done**
  - [x] US-1241: Make `RenderGrid.setOptions` apply shell layout live — **done**
  - [x] US-1235: Move the measured-row-height layer into av-grid (+ `fromRow`) — **done**; av-grid **2.3.0 published**
  - [x] US-1237: Migrate the UIKit primitives — **done**; Explorer tree verified rendering + scrolling
  - [x] US-1238: Migrate the remaining components and editors — **done**; Log View measured heights verified
  - [x] US-1239: Delete `uikit/VirtualGrid/` and `uikit/shared/async-ref.ts` — **done**

## EPIC-077 — Post-De-React Epic C: proportional work

Completed 2026-08-30. [Epic document](EPIC-077.md). R4, R5, R7, R8's residue, and R6's deferred
type half. Closing property: the work a view or model does in response to a change is proportional
to the change, not to the size of the collection it holds.

- Strand 1 — proportional work (closes the epic's four statements)
  - [x] US-1208: The `listen()`-on-update sweep, and Breadcrumb
  - [x] US-1209: Minimap — move the DOM mirror into the view, make it incremental
  - [x] US-1210: `CategoryViewImpl` — hoist the rebuild behind its own gate
  - [x] US-1211: The app-shell rebuild tail — `SecondaryViewsView` and the sidebar trio
  - [x] US-1212: The editor rebuild tail
  - [x] US-1213: Re-derive and fix the ungated `{ all: true }` sites
  - [x] US-1214: R5 — log-view entries out of immer
  - [x] US-1215: R5 — notebook notes out of immer
  - [x] US-1216: R5 — graph nodes out of immer
- Strand 2 — shape (closes nothing; cut first if the epic needs to be smaller)
  - [x] US-1217: The dialog shell — lift Escape once, then collapse the thin models
  - [x] US-1218: Merge the types-only component files
  - [x] US-1219: R7 residue — `FileList`, `ImageViewport`, `VirtualFlexGridModel`
  - [x] US-1220: R6's type half — narrow the contracts, shrink `dom-props.ts`
- Strand 3 — residue
  - [x] US-1221: The timing residue

## EPIC-078 — Post-De-React close-out: make the codebase stop claiming React

**Completed 2026-08-30.** Final epic of the post-De-React programme
(the De-React refactoring plan, deleted at programme close): R9's comment/shim/dependency sweep plus the four De-React residuals
recorded in [`backlog.md`](../tasks/backlog.md). Seven tasks, 127 changed files.

- **EPIC-078** — [Post-De-React close-out](EPIC-078.md) — R9 plus the backlog residuals. Cut
  2026-08-30 with **ten corrections to R9's citations**, including one live finding (a "shim" that
  outlived the task meant to delete it and turned out never to be a shim), one dead citation, one
  misread code-review item, and a sweep hazard: 79 correct uses of the project's own "reactive"
  vocabulary sit inside `grep -i react`'s blast radius. Started and completed 2026-08-30.
  - [x] US-1222: The four decisions — adapter fiction, `fill-slot` generation, janitor, the US-1023 shim
  - [x] US-1223: Rename `data-part="react-slot"` to `children-slot`
  - [x] US-1224: Dependency and documentation cleanup — drop `clsx`, fix the false shim comment
  - [x] US-1225: The React archaeology sweep
  - [x] US-1226: `ToolbarView`'s append-then-wipe trap
  - [x] US-1227: Panel roots — restore a stable inspection contract
  - [x] US-1228: Answer the `ListBoxView` `rowViews` retention question

**What closed.** React mentions in renderer `.ts` outside `editors/draw/` went 194 → **20**, each
load-bearing. All 79 `reactive`/`reactivity`/`reaction*` decoys are untouched — verified by counting
before and after *and* by confirming no changed line in the whole diff contains a decoy token.
`data-part="react-slot"` is gone from authored source (now `children-slot`); `data-react-root`, the
one marker that still means what it says, is retained. `clsx` is removed. `/review` fixed two
further stale comments; `/document` updated 13 developer documents; `/userdoc` correctly found
nothing user-facing to change.

**The finding that outlives the epic.** R9's recommendation for `ui/dialogs/poppers/grid-context-menu.ts`
— "self-declared shim, check US-1023's status and delete" — would have caused a visible regression.
It is a live adapter with four callers that replaces av-grid's **SVG source-string** icons with icon
elements; because `fillSlot` writes a string as `textContent`, deleting it would render raw
`<svg …>` markup as visible text in every grid context menu. Its header was a **garbled sentence**
whose exemption referred to the old React grid's UIKit-side handoff — a different file US-1023 did
delete. The lesson generalises: an exemption that survived its own deletion task deserves
investigation, not deletion on sight.

**Three defects a green build did not catch**, all found by verification: US-1227 shipped
half-applied (`searchPanel` never got the marker while its own acceptance criterion claimed
otherwise); a `declare global { interface ImportMeta … }` made a leaf uikit component the global
owner of a platform type; and two comments fell in the **seam** between US-1222 and US-1225, because
those files were excluded from the sweep as "owned by US-1222" while US-1222's scope was only the
four decisions. Partitioning a sweep by file rather than by line leaves seams.

**Where the epic was wrong and said so.** C-3 preferred "a trap removed beats a trap explained" for
`ToolbarView` and named a specific option. That option was not available — `collectStops()` treats
each direct root child as a toolbar stop and the CSS layout depends on direct children, so a wrapper
restructures focus and layout rather than containing anything. A dev-only child-identity snapshot
landed instead. Separately, the backlog's premise for US-1227 (callers override `data-type` "through
residual props") was obsolete — there is no props channel; the override is a post-construction
`dataset.type =` assignment — but the conclusion survived for a better reason: the custom values are
load-bearing CSS selectors, so an additive marker is the only safe option.

**Accepted unverified.** No panel with an overridden `data-type` rendered during verification, so the
new `data-component="panel"` marker's actual purpose is unexercised; likewise US-1226's dev warning
firing on a real manual append, and the `searchPanel` marker. A 44/44 panel match is not evidence for
the overridden case.

## EPIC-076 — Post-De-React Epic B: the props pump

**Completed 2026-08-30.** Second epic of the post-De-React programme (plan document deleted at close):
R2, the pump-entangled half of R6, and R10.4-6. Ten tasks, ~130 changed source files.

- **EPIC-076** — [Post-De-React Epic B: the props pump](EPIC-076.md) — R2, the pump-entangled
  half of R6, and R10.4-6. Cut 2026-08-29 with its figures re-measured; three of the plan's counts
  are withdrawn as non-comparable and the `(s) => s` sweep is narrowed to global state only.
  Started 2026-08-29.
  - [x] US-1199: Pilot — narrow the app-shell hot path off whole-state bindings
  - [x] US-1200: Write the convention — `update()` is configuration, callbacks are fields
  - [x] US-1201: Sidebar — `OpenTabsListView` and the re-entrant list views
  - [x] US-1202: Editor roots — stop fanning `{ model }` to every descendant
  - [x] US-1207: Editor roots — triage and convert bare subscriptions
  - [x] US-1203: The uikit drill — collapse the seven-layer props relay
  - [x] US-1203B: Compound dropdowns and the deferred editor edges
  - [x] US-1204: Retire the ref channels — `ElementRef`, `bindRef`, `onModel`
  - [x] US-1205: Derive-on-write — retire the 20 `memo()` sites, then delete `memo`/`IMemo`
  - [x] US-1206: `applyRestProps` at construction only

**What closed.** `VanillaView.update(props)` is now documented and used as construction-time
configuration; children that render live data subscribe to the slice they render. All four B-1
statements hold, verified rather than asserted: no whole-state selector on global state; callbacks
hoisted to stable fields in the converted areas; `this.memo` at zero with `memo`/`IMemo` deleted
from `TComponentModel` and every `ElementRef`/`bindRef`/`ref?:` channel retired; and
`applyRestProps` unreachable from any update path.

**What was deliberately left.** `dom-props.ts`'s type surface (R6's type half) goes to Epic C
alongside R7, which opens the same components. Three `GridBodyView.onModel` channels and `headerRef`
were retained because their models and elements do not exist at construction time. Seven
model-identity `throw` guards added in US-1202 were kept, contained by `AsyncEditorView`'s
`try/catch`. R4 full-rebuild sites, R5 immer collections and R8 timers are untouched.

**The finding that outlives the epic.** Roughly twenty of this epic's own stated facts failed
verification, and every one of them was inferred from code shape rather than observed. Three would
have caused regressions if implemented as written: "collapse the seven-layer relay" would have
broken the virtualized cell pool; "the DepsGate population should shrink" would have turned every
targeted push into a full repaint; and the obvious selector narrowing (`state.pages.map(...)`) would
have converted a mostly-gated binding into a fully ungated one, because `compareSelection` compares
arrays by identity. Two more near-misses were caught the same way: eager derive-on-write applied
uniformly would have made every tree drag pay an O(all-nodes) walk, and unifying the Popover content
factories would have broken either Select or Autocomplete. Counts published in this epic — including
two of my own — were wrong roughly a quarter of the time; a grep is a population, and only a
per-site verdict with a stated reason is a defect list.

## EPIC-075 — [Post-De-React Epic A: core contracts](EPIC-075.md)

**Completed 2026-08-29. All four closing statements hold, one of them with its instrument rewritten.**
Seven tasks, ~173 changed paths. `core/state/model.ts` lost **100 lines net**: `effect`,
`EffectRegistration`, `_evaluateEffects`, `hasRegisteredEffects`, `mapProps`, `onUnmount`,
`isFirstUse`, `oldProps`, the driver's throw branch, and the `postCreate` constructor timer every
model in the app paid for. `TComponentModel` ends as `props` + `setProps` + `init` + `dispose` +
`memo`. Renderer-wide: `this.effect(` **0**, `*Internal` callers outside `core/state/` **0**,
`isFirstUse`/`oldProps` **0**, `.unsubscribe()` **0**. `AppEvent` and `SubscriptionObject` deleted.
New: `core/utils/DisposableStore.ts` and `core/utils/scheduling.ts` (`Delayer`, `afterPaint`,
`focusAfterPaint`). `memo`/`IMemo` survive by decision (A-3), annotated for Epic B.

**Its largest finding is that the epic's own claims were the least reliable thing in it.** Five of
its stated facts did not survive contact with the code, and every one was inferred from shape rather
than observed:

1. **A-4 called the two `window` `"message"` listeners "real leaks … with no registered removal",
   and made that the justification for scoping US-1197 as a fix.** Neither leaked:
   `html/HtmlBodyView.ts` already used `this.own(...)`, and `board/BoardWebview.ts` cleared a
   `messageUnsubscribe` field in `onDispose()`.
2. **A-4 called the five dialog focus timers copies of "the same" timer.** All five already cleared
   on disposal, and two behave differently — `InputDialogView` *selects* rather than focuses, and
   `CreateBoardDialogView` chooses between two inputs from a mount-time snapshot. US-1198 is
   deduplication, not a leak fix.
3. **The zero-delay `setTimeout` census was 28, not "~11"** — 23 remain for R8.
4. **A-2's own correction was incomplete.** It recorded two teardown shapes; there were **three** —
   `settings.onChanged` goes through `wrapSubscription` and exposed `{ dispose }`. Fixing only
   `Subscription` would have left statement 4 false while looking done.
5. **A-4's instruction for US-1194 was wrong.** It said to assign the replacement previous-value
   field "at the **end** of `setProps`". `oldProps` is written unconditionally on every pump, but
   `CategoryViewModel.setProps` has an early return: with `multiSelect` off, `selectedHref` moving
   A → B takes that return and an end-assigned snapshot sticks at A, firing a selection seed later
   that `oldProps` never would. All three conversions use **capture → compare → immediately assign**,
   which is equivalent on every path by construction.

**Statement 3's instrument had to be rewritten mid-epic, and the correction generalises.** It
demanded "zero `private *Unsubscribe` / `*Subscription` teardown fields remain in views". **85
remain, and that is correct** — the rebindable US-1152 pattern the epic itself mandates *requires*
holding the release handle in a field (`this.pageStateUnsubscribe = this.ownSubscription(...)`).
Driving the count to zero would mean deleting the ability to rebind. A-5 had already warned the
field count *undercounts* (a differently-named field or a closure passes); it also **overcounts**, by
scoring the prescribed pattern as a defect. The clause was struck and completion measured by a
**354-site semantic census** built from `.subscribe(` / `.watch(` / `.on(` / `addEventListener(` call
sites: **62 already owned, 198 converted, 94 deliberately unowned** — every exception carrying a
source comment naming its owner. *A census keyed to how a construct is stored is not a census of the
construct.*

**Three silent-behaviour changes were caught in plan review, none of which would have failed a
build.** (a) `onUnmountInternal` runs its cleanup loop *before* `dispose()`, and that loop was the
only thing unsubscribing `eMcpStatusChanged`/`eMnemeStatusChanged` — with `_effects` empty it does
nothing, leaking one listener per Settings open/close; `GitIntegrationModel` had **no** `dispose()`
at all while its `setProbe` has no liveness guard. (b) `CustomEvent.detail` is **`null`** when
nothing is sent, where a plain listener array passes `undefined` — `Subscription.send()` now
normalizes. (c) DOM `dispatchEvent` surfaces a listener throw as an **uncaught** error; a naive
`catch`/`console.error` would have preserved dispatch while silently downgrading error visibility,
so `Emitter` re-throws asynchronously. A fourth was avoided by measurement rather than reasoning:
the plan would have rewritten eight models whose `dispose` is a class-field arrow into prototype
methods, and compiling that exact shape against `target: ESNext` showed it is accepted —
`super.dispose()` from inside the field arrow included.

**Scope discipline held in two places.** `RunOnceScheduler` and `Throttler` were dropped for having
no call site — `Delayer` shipped only because its caller (`GraphLegendModel.scheduleDescription`)
was converted with it. And US-1197 was split into two separately verified deliveries (11 behavioural
sites, then the 198-site sweep) rather than one 218-site diff, with 62 already-correct `own(...)`
calls left un-renamed so the sweep stayed reviewable.

**Verified by use, not by grep**, across full renderer reloads: the `EventChannel.sendAsync` LIFO
short-circuit driven end-to-end through `openRawLink` (page created, `handled === true`); Settings'
MCP/Mneme/Git/Tor-port gates including same-value no-ops and unrelated-key isolation; page
create/dispose cycles; menu reopen; tree expansion surviving a rebuild; notebook `syncTags`
re-attach proven by removing a second tag from the *rebuilt* DOM; and four of the five focus dialogs.

**Accepted unverified at close**, recorded with repro steps in the epic's Notes: the `selectedHref`
reveal inside an Explorer editor (the virtualized tree defeated every DOM instrument tried), Browser
Profiles add/remove/clear, `CreateBoardDialogView`'s two-input branch, toggling `mcp.enabled` (it
severs the agent's own MCP transport), Default Browser registration, the Tor dialog's explicit
`postCreate()`, `afterPaint`'s 100 ms fallback in a non-painting window, and `ComponentQueue`
request/reply under a real editor workload.

## EPIC-074 — [De-React Epic F: React confined](EPIC-074.md)

**Completed 2026-08-28. The De-React programme is finished.** `react` and `react-dom` are importable
from exactly **one directory** — `src/renderer/editors/draw/` — and `npm run lint` fails if that
changes. The only `.tsx` file in the repository is `editors/draw/ExcalidrawIsland.tsx`.

`react` importers **85 → 2**, React *value* users **16 → 2**, type-only **69 → 0**, non-story `.tsx`
**10 → 1**, story `.tsx` **2 → 0**. 169 files changed, **+468 / −2,877**. Deleted: 10 dead
`mountVanilla` faces and the vanilla-to-React adapter, 9 dead hook entry points, the dead
`IState.use()` hook path (15 wrapper call sites), storybook's React arm with the `Panel`/`Text` faces,
and the React event proxy. Emotion `<Global>` became a native `theme/global-styles.ts`, which killed
the last always-live React root. `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled` and `react-markdown` are
uninstalled; **`react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` stay installed
permanently** — Excalidraw declares the first two as peer dependencies and its own `.d.ts` imports
React, so no amount of our own work removes them. That is the stated outcome, not a shortfall.

**Its largest finding is about measurement, not React: a census keyed to one spelling of a construct
is not a census of the construct.** The instrument that has measured React usage in every epic since
A was wrong **three times here**, each differently, each time producing a confident wrong total —
(1) the import regex hardcoded double quotes, hiding `core/state/state.ts`, which calls four React
hooks, from *every figure this programme ever published*; (2) `@types/react` declares a global `React`
namespace, so `core/traits/dnd.ts:48` referenced React types with no import at all, invisible to any
import-based query; (3) the value test looked for `React.member`, so
`scripting/ScriptContext.ts:64`'s `readonly React = React` — a namespace used as a value, never
dereferenced — was filed as type-only. Defects 1 and 3 were **blocking**: both files were React value
users outside `editors/draw/`, so the epic's own closing rule could not have passed while either
stood. *An epic whose deliverable is a lint rule cannot be scoped by a query weaker than the rule.*
The corrected baseline was 85/16/69, not the 84/14/70 the epic published at scoping time.

**Two plan corrections it made on itself.** F-e and F-f were ordered wrongly: the runtime half
(`applyRestProps`) and the type half (`React.HTMLAttributes`) of one contract lived in different
tasks, and doing runtime first left every `on*` handler receiving a native `Event` while its declared
type promised a synthetic one — nothing failing to compile while
`editors/link-editor/index.ts:260`'s `event.nativeEvent` silently became `undefined`. Reversed, with
the general rule: **when a contract's runtime and its types are changed by separate tasks, change the
types first — a type change fails loudly and lists the work, a runtime change fails silently and
hides it.** And F-h could not "just delete `mount.tsx`": `VanillaViewCtor`, the type the whole vanilla
architecture rests on, was stranded in that React module with 13 references across eight subsystems,
and relocating it touched more files than the rule did.

**One breaking change, recorded rather than absorbed:** the injected `React` script global is gone.
It was documented (`docs/scripting.md`, `whats-new.md:1145`) but provably inert — no script-facing API
can consume a React value across all 40 `assets/editor-types/*.d.ts`, and it never had typings — so a
script could build a React element nothing could render. Scripts referencing `React` now throw
`ReferenceError`; a what's-new entry says so.

`/review` found two must-fix items, both real and both fixed: `dom-props.ts` compared enumerated
attributes case-sensitively while the new props type spells them camelCase, so `spellCheck={true}`
would have written `""` — which for an enumerated attribute means *auto*, the opposite of the
request — and the props type omitted `draggable` while the helper still special-cased it. A rename
that makes an implicit contract explicit surfaces disagreements that were always there.

Also recorded: **`execute_script` cannot use dynamic `import()`** (V8 rejects it inside `new Function`
with a *parse* error naming no import — use the `app` global instead), and raw HTTP to the app's own
MCP endpoint is not a usable verification fallback. Left unverified by decision: the theme-switch
stylesheet rebuild (argued sound by inspection; `app.settings.set("theme", …)` does **not** apply a
theme in-session, which is a property of the settings path and not evidence about the subscription),
plus the post-proxy event checks now tracked with US-1173.

## EPIC-073 — [De-React Epic E15: the last React editor](EPIC-073.md)

**Completed 2026-08-28.** Epic E is finished: **no editor in Persephone produces React except the one
a vendor requires.** The last five React editor bodies are native — `env-vars`, `file-diff`,
`rest-client`, `graph`, and `draw` reduced to an 87-line Excalidraw island — the 18-face
`mountVanilla` layer is deleted after its props types were relocated into native modules, and the
residual React paths are gone from `PopoverView`, `DialogView`, `highlight.ts`, `fill-slot.ts` and
four uikit views. JSX markers **403 → 10**, `editors/` **385 → 2**, non-story `.tsx` **50 → 9**,
faces **21 → 0**, `react` importers **116 → 84**, React *runtime* users **39 → 14**. `editors/` now
contains exactly one `.tsx`.

**Its largest finding was not about React at all: a sized element is not a rendered one.** Two
defects reached the tree and **both passed every structural check**. The Excalidraw island host `div`
— an element the React original never had — was created bare, so `display: block; height: 0` made
Excalidraw's `height: 100%` resolve against zero and the canvas collapsed. And `GraphBodyView` kept
only the *unmount* half of the original's `canvasRef` callback, so `setCanvas()` was never called:
the renderer built no simulation, never ran `handleResize()`, and left the canvas **backing store at
the HTML default 300×150 while the element measured 1557×949**. At the moment each shipped the
readings were 0 React roots on the correct host, no crash, correct element geometry, and — for graph —
a footer correctly reporting the fixture's node count from the model. All true; both features blank.
The instruments that found them were a walk down the height chain and a **canvas pixel histogram**.
The corollary, proven twice: *introducing a nesting level the original did not have is a layout
change* — which is why `mountVanilla`'s host is deliberately `display: contents` while
`mountReactHandle`'s must be sized by its caller.

**It also discovered that the programme's stated ending was impossible, and the user redefined it.**
`draw` was scoped as the second-easiest task and was the only one that could not reach the goal:
`@excalidraw/excalidraw` declares `react`/`react-dom` as peer dependencies with no non-React entry
point. The scoping had measured markers, files and lines correctly and never asked *what does this
file import, and can that thing exist without React?* (**C18**). That invalidated Epic F's opening
line — "Delete `react-dom`, then `react`" — and the **user decision (2026-08-27)** is that the
terminal state is **"React only where a vendor requires it"**, scoped to the Excalidraw editor, with
relocating Excalidraw into persephone-boards explicitly out of the programme. Removing the draw
*editor* would not free React either: four other files take pure helpers from the same single-entry
package, and `drawExport.ts` alone has seven consumers including the native `image`, `mermaid`, `svg`
and `graph` editors.

**Closing statement 4 was wrong as written, and is corrected rather than reinterpreted.** It claimed
React's runtime is reachable from exactly two places; there are three — `GlobalStyles` at
`index.tsx:15`, "the sole startup React root", live in *every* session, which the rest of the epic
document acknowledged and the statement simply failed to count. Statements 1–3 were met.

**Instruments failed seven times and a third failure class appeared.** Beyond E15-3's five scoping
failures and two implementation ones, **five validation cases went stale mid-epic** because each
named a file the work deleted. Every time the script refused to publish numbers and exited non-zero —
the guard built in at E15-3 earned itself seven times over — but each refusal cost a re-baseline.
*Pin known answers to invariants, not to conversion targets.* Two false alarms were also recorded,
both from verification rather than code: a hand-invented `.rest.json` schema (the real `body` is a
`string`) crashed Monaco, and the corrected fixture *still* showed the crash because `openRawLink`
reactivates an existing page rather than remounting it — **to re-test a crash fix, open a fresh
path.**

`/review` found six must-fix items, all applied and re-verified: four editor `index.ts` files used
`!` lifecycle fields instead of the codebase's `| undefined` pattern, `GraphBodyView` dereferenced
`tooltip!` in a closure, and its loading `SpinnerView` was never claimed through `this.child(...)`
so its cleanup never ran — a real C1 violation. `/userdoc` correctly found nothing: the epic changed
no behaviour by design.

Carried forward to Epic F: the ~70-file React **type** surface (the actual blocker on uninstalling
anything); an **enforceable** closing statement — an ESLint rule confining `react` imports to
`editors/draw/**`, with 84 importers as the baseline; the three live React roots; and seven
hook-exporting modules whose React consumers are now gone and which should be **re-measured for
deadness rather than converted**. Unverified and worth a human pass: the dialog commit/focus path,
popover resize (reachable only via its storybook story), graph interaction, and rest-client's Monaco
hosts.

## EPIC-072 — [De-React Epic E14: the `Component` arm dies](EPIC-072.md)

**Completed 2026-08-27.** `EditorModule.Component` no longer exists: the registry has one required
`View` arm, no React import, and no `mountVanilla` normalisation shim. `board` and `browser` — the last
two React editors, hosting a cross-origin `iframe` and a per-tab `<webview>` — are native, and
`PageSlot`/`PageManagerView` are native too, so **every editor in the application now mounts through a
native per-page path**. `@floating-ui/react` is uninstalled. JSX markers **566 → 403** (`editors/`
542 → 385), non-story `.tsx` **85 → 50**, and a live session with a board, a browser and a markdown
editor measures **1** React root — `GlobalStyles`, Epic F's target — down from 9 at baseline. Five files
died because their last caller was converted: `PageManager.tsx`, `BoardGlyph.tsx`, `BoardsTree.tsx`,
`ToolsTree.tsx`, and the shim.

**It was scoped against a fresh measurement rather than E13's handoff, and the measurement split the
work.** E13 named E14 as Epic E's last epic with seven editors; measured, `board`+`browser` are one
*atomic* unit (the arm cannot go while either survives) and the other five are independent bodies that
can never block anything. Combining them would have produced an epic unable to close if either host
conversion stalled. It also corrected four claims in that handoff — `board` hosts an **iframe**, not a
`<webview>`; the arm survived only because two three-line JSX wrappers existed, not for any hosting
reason; the `@floating-ui/react` uninstall was gated on **one** importer; and the marker figure was 542,
not 535.

**Its headline finding is ownership on a shared key, and it cost a user-visible bug to learn.**
`BoardWebview` called `port.close()` on a port whose `boardId` did not match — but `api.onBoardPort` is a
**global** subscription, so that port belonged to another live frame, and closing it killed that frame's
bridge (the user saw a board with no data or chart). The close review then found **four more instances of
the same shape**: the browser's `webviewRefs` and `webviewReady` deletes, its main-process IPC
registration, and the board's CDP frame unregister — the last two keyed in main by a bare string, so a
stale view could unregister a live one. Stated as **C1a**: *when something arrives on a shared broadcast,
map, or registry key, the entry you did not create belongs to somebody else — ignoring and disposing are
not interchangeable.* Its counterweight matters equally: C1 tells a conversion to make implicit teardown
**explicit**, and that pressure makes *more* disposal feel safer than less. It is not; the React
originals were correct because they did less. **The class is invisible to every instrument this programme
uses** — root, iframe and webview counts were all correct while the bridge was dead.

**Its second finding indicts this programme's verification style.** US-1155's live pass was declined as
unreachable and replaced with a structural proof that no value on that path could create a React root.
Sound, true, and **vacuous**: the review found `trailingElement` was dropped before the row renderer, so
the subtree was empty. The pin buttons and Update tags were built, claimed, mounted, and never inserted.
The cause was an error in the *plan review* — the correction named `ListItemView.setTrailing()` with real
`ListBox` evidence, but `TreeView` renders `TreeItemView`, a different class with its own `setTrailing()`.
So: **a proof of absence is not a proof of presence**, every closing statement phrased as a removal is
satisfiable by deletion, and a deferred live pass should be recorded as *unverified* rather than replaced
with a measurement of a different property.

**Instruments failed four more times.** Three before any number was published (a `*.stories.tsx` glob
that matched nothing; an import gate testing stripped source where every module path had become `""`;
and E13's own JSX stripper treating an apostrophe in JSX prose as a string opener, which made
`file-diff` measure zero while holding a full React body). The fourth recurred three times and is new:
**querying the first matching element instead of the visible one** — it reported identical element counts
for two different editors and made a *working* board reload look broken. Where inactive pages stay in the
DOM, "the element" and "the visible element" are different queries.

**US-1160 also relocated its own fix by probing rather than reading.** A module-load rejection surfaces
at `showEditorPage` → `createEditor` → `loadModule`, one layer below `AsyncEditorView`, because
`createEditor` needs the module to build the editor model. The added `.catch()` is defence-in-depth; the
reachable failure is a **silent no-op** — no page, no message, nothing reported (**US-1163**). Verified
positively: constructor and `onMount()` throws both show a native "Editor crashed" panel with message and
stack, and a crash no longer reintroduces React.

Carried forward: **US-1163**, the deferred type assertions, and the browser's network-dependent surfaces
(navigation, downloads, bookmarks, Tor, incognito, suggestions, drag-and-drop, hover preview) which
remain *could not reach with the available instrument* — several review findings were in exactly that
untested region.

## EPIC-071 — [De-React Epic E13: the editor bodies that still build React](EPIC-071.md)

**Completed 2026-08-27.** The first epic in this programme scoped purely by **body**: its contract
search came back negative for the third consecutive time, so there was no React-typed declaration left
pinning callers that would otherwise be vanilla. Eight editors converted — `monaco`, `about`,
`tools-hub`, `mneme-root`, `mneme-config`, `settings`, `mcp-inspector`, `link-editor` — plus the
`VanillaView` lifecycle guard and the `uikit/` face collection.

**All four closing properties met:**

| Property | Result |
|---|---|
| `EditorModule.Component` reduced to the `<webview>` editors only | **8 → 2** (`board`, `browser`) |
| Faces removed from the value graph | **9** — 2 deleted, 7 type-relocated to `.ts` |
| One React root on the everyday path | **1** (`GlobalStyles`) across 17 open tabs, 0 empty SVGs app-wide |
| Converted bodies produce no React | zero React imports/JSX/`createElement` in all eight folders |

`editors/` JSX markers **1,337 → 535** (60% of the remaining editor JSX); `editors/` non-story `.tsx`
76 → 36; `uikit/` 51 → 39; renderer 136 → 85.

**The headline was met at task 2 of 10.** `MonacoBody.tsx` — one 239-line file — accounted for three of
the app's four live React roots. The other eight tasks bought the arm property, the collection and the
guard, none of which a root count shows: **a single metric would have declared the epic finished after
its second task**, which is the argument for the four-part closing property it opened with.

**Its largest finding is about instruments, not React.** The epic corrected its own measurement **four
times**, always the same mistake: E12's `createElement` column counted `document.createElement` and the
icon builders E12 itself had just created (12 React-producing editors read as 7); a constructor `append`
scan read 49 sites as 2; a hook-token count read 47 as 35; and — the dangerous one — the JSX face matcher
`<Sym[[:space:]/>]` missed **every multi-line opening tag**, so twelve *live* faces looked dead and a task
had been scheduled to delete them. The mechanism: **a grep counts occurrences of a string; a measurement
counts occurrences of a behaviour, and the gap is always filled by imports, comments, types, generics and
the codebase's own dominant formatting convention.** Narrowing a pattern is not validating it; validation
costs one line — run the instrument against a case whose answer you already know.

**Close review: nine findings, six fixed, three handed to US-1152.** Finding 3 resolved the one thing
the epic could not explain: `settings` measured 25 buttons against a baseline of 24 because
`LibraryPathSectionView` always built a clear button that React had rendered **conditionally**. Settings
now matches its pre-conversion baseline on **15 of 16** element counts. The lesson corrected the epic's
own reasoning: an unexplained mismatch surrounded by exact matches is *more* likely to be real, not
less — fifteen matches are evidence the instrument is sound. Also fixed: 6 panel-type casts, 24
`undefined as never` clears, **135 definite-assignment assertions**, and 5 non-null assertions. One cast
survives, documented rather than silenced, because removing it needs the deferred `SlotText` →
`SlotContent` migration.

**Carried forward:** `graph` (the largest remaining body, with a canvas and the last `highlight.ts`
React consumer), `rest-client`, `browser`, `board`, `env-vars`, `file-diff`, `draw` and
`editors/base/EditorError.tsx` — 535 markers, E14's scope, inherited as a list rather than a search.
Also **US-1152** (five pre-existing secondary views that bind as if their model were fixed), **US-1153**
(`mneme-root` and `link-editor` tiles mode, closed unverified), and the measurement that the biggest
React concentration in the app is **not an editor** — `tools-hub`'s Registered-boards tab holds 26
roots, 24 of them one *per visible row* in shell code E12 named as a survivor without weighing it.

---

## EPIC-070 — [De-React Epic E12: the shell's React-typed content](EPIC-070.md)

**Completed 2026-08-27.** Three contracts outside `editors/` still declared **React** for content the
producer already held as **DOM**, each with a DOM twin already built and already dominant: the per-page
React island (`renderPage: (id) => ReactNode`), the icon component type (`SvgIconComponent`), and
`FileList.getTrailing`. All three are gone.

**Measured against the captured baseline on the same session shape** (7 pages open, 3 activated):
**React roots 6 → 3**, the three survivors exactly as predicted — `GlobalStyles`, `MonacoBody`, and the
board editor's `board-host`. **The Rule 4 instrument is honest for the first time in the programme**:
`1 (GlobalStyles) + 1 per React-producing editor instance`, with **no term that scales with open
tabs** — 4 of 7 open pages now cost nothing. `theme/icons.tsx` → `theme/icons.ts`, `SvgIconComponent`
reduced to `{ createElement; viewBox? }` with **no call signature**, **116 icon React components → 1**
generic face, 30 named icon JSX tags → **0**, 17 slot contracts widened to `SlotContent`, both
DOM→React laundering sites deleted, 9 dead faces + 4 dead barrels + 2 stubs collected. Renderer
non-story `.tsx` 162 → **136**; non-editor JSX markers 62 → **11**. `editors/` deliberately
**unchanged at 1337 markers**, reported so the epic is not misread as progress against Epic E.

**The closing property was checked file by file, not by a count.** Each of the eleven non-editor files
still holding JSX was matched to what keeps it alive — the boundary itself, the Emotion root, the error
boundary eight editor modules need, the two faces with no vanilla twin, the generic `Icon` face, and
views held by the `tools-hub` and browser editors. Epic F inherits a list of which editor conversion
frees which file.

**Its largest finding is not about its own cut: the programme's headline metric was a proxy and it was
wrong.** `EditorModule.Component` callers measures which arm a module *registers on*, not whether it
produces React — `monaco` has counted as converted since E2 while mounting `MonacoBody` as a React
element, and **twelve `View`-arm editors still produce React**, all live. What remains of Epic E is
re-cut on the body count.

**And a sharper variant of that lesson: a count off by one is not a rounding error, it is an
unexamined case.** 115 of 116 icons matched the scoping regex and I read that as "all of them". The
missing one — `PersephoneIcon`, the only JSX-bodied icon, the only theme-dependent one, and the only
icon whose artwork existed *twice* — was the strongest case for the change.

**Four carry-forward findings:** a `mountVanilla` face outlives its last caller silently, and a dead
barrel is what hides it; a split leaves a stub, and a stub is a face (passing that finding into the
next brief made that task find two of its own); a scope fence drawn to prevent a collision also hides
what is behind it (`Ornament.tsx` survived inside one); and widening a type is a promise the
implementation must keep or not make.

**Its close review found three real defects**, the most instructive being a *silenced* violation
rather than a bug: UIKit imported the new app-coupled `Icon` face under an
`eslint-disable import/no-restricted-paths` — the only `uikit/ → components/` import in the codebase.
**A suppression comment is the same tell as `as unknown as`, `icon as never` and `asReactNode`**, all
three of which this epic deleted while adding a fourth of the same kind without noticing. Also fixed:
`PageSlot.renderNative` had no mount-failure rollback, which would have left a page **permanently
blank for the session**, and `PageSlot.dispose` could leak one arm.

---

## EPIC-069 — [De-React Epic E11: the Storybook contract](EPIC-069.md)

**The first epic whose search reversed its predecessor's verdict rather than an inherited candidate.**
E10 closed on a negative — "the remaining React is terminal" — having measured
`Story.component: React.ComponentType` and set it aside as *"a genuine contract pinning a harness,
not the app."* That phrase was the error: what it pinned was `uikit/`. 21 of the 49 face files had
zero non-story JSX users and 15 were held by exactly one caller — their own story — so the removal
ledger's "React faces … collectable once Epic E finishes" row had been stating the wrong unblock
condition since C1, because Epic E cannot remove a story. It was also the programme's first
**single-armed** contract: every earlier one had a vanilla arm built beside it, `Story` had none, so
the arm had to be built before anything could convert.

| Measure | Start | End |
|---|---|---|
| `.story.tsx` / `.story.ts` | 43 / 2 | **2 / 43** |
| `Story.component` callers | 44 | **2** (`Panel`, `Text` — permanent, §E11-4) |
| Storybook editor non-story `.tsx` | 6 (396 lines) | **0** |
| Editors on the React `Component` arm | 9 | **8** |
| `uikit/` non-story `.tsx` | 70 | **51** |
| Renderer non-story `.tsx` | 187 | **162** |
| Stories rendering | 44 of 45 | **45, zero failures** |
| React roots, Storybook page, per vanilla story | 1 + slots | **1** — `uikit/Toolbar`'s, not this epic's |

**Three measurement lessons, all the same shape.** The scoping used file extensions, an import list
and JSX tag counts, and all three lied. `.tsx` overstated the surface — **64 of 70** non-story `.tsx`
files in `uikit/` contain no JSX at all. The import list gave "45 stories" by counting the `Story`
*type* import; the real registry held **44**, plus one orphan (`SelectableRow.story.tsx`, written in
C1 and never registered, so the roadmap's "42 of 44 have a story" was overstated by one). And the tag
count classified **35 demo-wrapper stories as mechanical** — they render a story-local React wrapper,
several written with `React.createElement` and therefore tagless — which turned "point 35 stories at a
view" into "rewrite 35 demo wrappers as `VanillaView`s" and forced the task list to be re-cut
mid-epic by wrapper complexity.

**The epic's own headline number was wrong, and usefully so.** It predicted "≥15 faces deleted" and
delivered **2**, because each face file is *also* its props-type module (`Menu.tsx` has 28 type
importers, `Dialog.tsx` 16). The accurate result: **20 of 49 React components removed as dead code**,
2 files deleted, 17 reduced to type-only modules renamed `.ts`. Deleting a face is a
**type-relocation** job — Epic F's shape — and the ledger now carries the three-way split
(3 free / 17 type-only / 29 still-live) with importer counts.

**Three unreleased bugs found, two of them live crashes**, none catchable by any gate:

- `NotificationView`'s constructor touched a child field before `onMount()` created it, so every
  construction threw — **no toast or alert in the app could render** (EPIC-066).
- `BlockingBranchView` did the same — **the blocking progress overlay could not render** — and
  `ProgressPillView` leaked a `SpinnerView` created in its constructor (EPIC-055, on the branch since
  2026-08-21). Both surfaced by the close review.

That is **four violations of one rule across three epics** — *the constructor must not create or touch
child DOM* — and `private x: T | undefined` makes every one of them compile. Carried forward as
**US-1131**: guard it mechanically before the next conversion epic, since every remaining epic writes
new `VanillaView` subclasses.

**What converting a harness bought beyond the contract.** The stories became `uikit/`'s **first
non-React consumer**, and that immediately surfaced **six under-declared public props** —
`CollapsiblePanelStack.buttons`, `DialogContent.headerButtons`, `Tree`/`ListBox.renderItem`,
`ListBox`/`Autocomplete.emptyMessage` — all consumed by `fillSlot`, which already accepted `Node`, yet
declared `ReactNode` only. Each fix was one word; in the first case the correct type was already on
the adjacent line. That is a fair answer to §E11-5 concern 2's accepted loss of face coverage.

**Two process findings.** A pre-conversion **DOM baseline** was the only instrument that caught
anything: it found three silent regressions in the first batch — `spacer` rendering nothing visible at
all — with `tsc`, ESLint and `build-prod` green, in the same task whose summary reported three *other*
stories as blocked. Hence the rule the epic ran on afterwards: *a report of what could not be done is
not evidence about what was done*, so every later task was gated on the DOM diff, never the summary.
And the harness must render through the **real** preparation path — duplicating `LivePreview`'s
prop preparation for verification produced a false regression report, fixed structurally by exporting
`prepareStoryProps()`.

Also narrower than EPIC-068 stated: touching the importer clears a stale `.tsx` → `.ts` rename for a
**static** import, but a module reached through a **dynamic** `import()` needs the dev server
restarted. A frozen `?t=` timestamp in the error distinguishes the two.

---

## EPIC-068 — [De-React Epic E10: the `PageToolbar` editor group](EPIC-068.md)

The first epic in this programme whose **contract search came back negative**. Five epics running had
found one React-typed member pinning otherwise-vanilla callers; every candidate here failed that
test, each for a different reason — `EditorModule.Component` is load-bearing (15 editors, but their
bodies are genuinely React), the three surviving chrome props are *nominal* (all three files are pure
`mountVanilla` shims, so by E8's own test they bind no implementation), `SvgIconComponent` is live but
thin (45 importers, only 32 JSX usages), the `applyRestProps` bridge is a real contract whose
precondition is unmet, `Story.component` is a genuine contract pinning a **harness** rather than the
app, and `renderItems` had one caller. What the negative says: the remaining React is **terminal** —
React because its own content is React, not because a type above it demands React. So the axis became
content, cut along *the connected component of the `PageToolbar` module graph* (E8's atomic unit):
six editors, 2,895 of the 9,497 JSX lines left in `editors/`. Seven tasks, all reviewed.

| Measure | Start | End |
|---|---|---|
| `<PageToolbar` JSX call sites | 6 | **0** |
| `PageToolbar.ts` callers (incl. `SwitchWidget`) | 7 | **0** — the file is deleted |
| Editors on the React `Component` arm | 15 | **9** |
| Editors registering `View` | 15 | **21** |
| JSX lines in the six editors | 2,895 | **9** (a deliberate shim) |
| `.tsx` in `editors/` (non-story) | 94 | **76** |
| Renderer non-story `.tsx` | 205 | **187** |
| React roots per converted editor | 1 each | **0 each** |

**Rule 4, honestly.** Five of the six were verified live, each measuring 0 `[data-react-root]` and 0
`[data-part="react-slot"]` with real content rendering. **`git-tree` is recorded as statically
verified but live-unverified** — both programmatic open routes are closed (`addEditorPage` refuses it
as "a standalone editor that requires a specialized model") and the user was working in the app, so
it was not worth disturbing their session. Same discipline E9 applied to `svg-view`. Whole-app roots
read 3 at close (`GlobalStyles` + one per open board page), matching the baseline arithmetic exactly.

**Four findings outlast the epic**, and three are the same lesson from different directions —
*what React did for free by destroying things must become explicit when nothing is destroyed*:

- **Never pass a `DocumentFragment` to a slot.** Slots are re-filled unconditionally
  (`PageToolbarView.onUpdate:420-427`) and `fill-slot.ts:137` appends, which *empties* a fragment — so
  mount works and the first update deletes the content. EPIC-064's "a cache of a resource is a bug" in
  its purest form: a fragment is destroyed by the act of being used.
- **`bind()` is only for state that outlives the view.** It registers its unsubscribe through `own()`,
  which has **no early-release API**, so re-binding a changing-source subscription both leaks and lets
  stale sources keep pushing values — selection visibly fighting itself, not merely waste. §4's
  "forgotten unsubscribe", found in the wild.
- **A `useMemo` whose result feeds a callback becomes dead code if the port defines the recompute but
  never calls it.** The close review's sharpest catch: `changeMapFor()` was defined and never called,
  so commit badges and an "Open in new Tab" action were silently missing with every gate green. An
  empty `Map` is still a `Map`, and the symptom is *absence* — which no root count can measure.
- **A view that measures its own root cannot use a `display: contents` root** — no box, so
  `ResizeObserver` never fires and `getBoundingClientRect()` reads zero, silently. Two of the epic's
  own rules conflicted here; the measurement wins.

**It retired one of its own concerns rather than implementing it.** E10-5 concern 7 predicted
`BoardScreenshot.tsx` would need post-paint sizing with a bounded retry; it measures nothing at all,
and the implementation brief was told explicitly *not* to add it — otherwise the epic document would
have talked someone into writing dead complexity. Fifth instance of *a forward-looking note is a
measurement with a date on it*, this time caught inside the epic that wrote it. It also **rejected
E9's named E10 candidate on re-measurement**: `SecondaryViews.tsx` was credited with 4 roots when that
note was written and accounts for 0 now.

**E10-4's correction.** The removal ledger recorded six `PageToolbar` callers; the module had a
**seventh** through its `SwitchWidget` export (`board/BoardToolbar.tsx:160`). That site now calls
`mountVanilla(SwitchWidgetView, …)` directly, so the module deleted at 0 callers without converting
`board`. *A ledger row names the callers someone counted, and a module can have callers of a
different export — grep the module path, not the component name.*

**Process finding.** The per-task briefs accumulated ten rules with a file:line each; the first three
tasks needed corrections and the last two needed **none**. *A correction applied once is a fix; a
correction written into the next brief is a class removed.* Every `.tsx` → `.ts` conversion also hit
the dev-server **stale dynamic-import trap** — the editor silently fails to load until
`register-editors.ts` is touched. `build-prod` is unaffected; it belongs in the routine, not the
diagnosis.

**Left deliberately.** `BoardScreenshot.tsx` survives as an 8-line `mountVanilla` shim
(`tools-hub/SearchBoardsTab.tsx:158` still renders it). `EditorToolbar` (3 callers) and
`ContentHostFooter` (1) keep their React faces and ledger clauses. `createContentsRoot()` is
duplicated locally in eight files — extracting it was out of scope for a per-editor epic.

| Task | Title |
|---|---|
| US-1112 | `image` → `View` (the pilot) |
| US-1113 | `archive` → `View` |
| US-1114 | `category` → `View`, plus the `renderItems` widen/migrate/narrow |
| US-1115 | `board-info` → `View`, plus `subscribeCatalog` |
| US-1116 | `git-tree` → `View` |
| US-1117 | `video` → `View` |
| US-1118 | `SwitchWidget` moved; `PageToolbar.ts` deleted at 0 callers |

## EPIC-067 — [De-React Epic E9: the editor chrome contract](EPIC-067.md)

The contract was `TextChromeProps`' four `ReactNode` members — `children`, `toolbarContributions`,
`rightToolbarContributions`, `footerContributions` — consumed by **14 editors** and pinning every one
of them to React regardless of its own content. The qualifying evidence: seven of the fourteen already
had a vanilla `BodyView`, and their only remaining `.tsx` file was the `index.tsx` whose whole job was
to wrap that vanilla body in `<TextChrome>`. Nine tasks, all reviewed.

| Measure | Start | End |
|---|---|---|
| `<TextChrome>` call sites | 14 | **0** — the file is deleted |
| `TextChromeProps`' `ReactNode` members | 4 | **0** |
| Editors registering `EditorModule.View` | 1 | **15** |
| Editors on the `Component` arm | 30 | 15 |
| `.tsx` files in `editors/base` | 5 | **1** (`EditorError.tsx`) |
| `.tsx` files in `editors/text` | 1 | **0** |
| Renderer non-story `.tsx` | 225 | **205** |
| JSX-bearing files, renderer-wide | 126 | **106** |
| JSX-bearing files in `editors/` | 107 | **88** |
| React roots on opening a chrome editor | 2 | **0** (6 editors) / 1–2 (7 with React bodies) |

**Rule 4, honestly.** Six editors reach 0. Seven **relocate** the root into a still-React body, which
the epic predicted and which is why its closing property never promised 0 across the board. The
documented intermediate peak of 4–5 roots — inherent to the epic rather than to its ordering, since
Rule 1 keeps parents React for at least one task — is gone. `svg-view` is recorded as **unmeasured**:
`addEditorPage` does not force an editor id, so that row had measured `monaco` in both the baseline
and the first closing draft. Fourth Rule 4 instrument correction in the programme, and the same shape
as the third — make the instrument report what it actually measured.

**Four §6.1 masked defects fixed**, each surviving only on an incidental React re-render:
`RunButtons`' `hasTextSelection()`, `ContentHostFooter`'s self-documented forced re-render,
`NavPanelButton`'s three unsubscribed reads, and `ScriptPanel`'s result-less
`libraryService.state.use()`. For the first, the channel **already existed** — `MonacoEditor` has kept
`hasSelection` in state for years and `hasTextSelection()` reads it; the only thing missing was a
`bind`. Where a channel genuinely did not exist, one was added in the service that owns the private
state (`subscribeCatalogBoardsForFile`, `subscribeInstalled`), each sharing one extracted projection
with its existing hook so the two cannot drift.

**Five lessons worth carrying:**

- **Derive task order from the import graph, not from the containment relationship you are thinking
  about.** `ScriptPanel` is a child of `TextChrome` but is not the chrome's leaf; converting it first
  would have added a React root in an epic measured in roots. Caught at plan review.
- **A cast at a `mountVanilla` face means the view's props and the face's props disagree — fix the
  relationship, not the type.** A footer that *extends* a toolbar silently inherits its props type.
- **The `SlotContent` widening rule** — native class takes `SlotContent`, React face keeps
  `React.ReactNode`. E8's residue, surfacing from the other side, in three of nine tasks.
- **A deferral is a measurement with a date on it.** E1-8 was right about the mechanism and the
  magnitude and wrong only to treat a transient cost as a permanent reason. The epic's own first draft
  then made the mirror-image error in the paragraph diagnosing it.
- **Replacing a forced re-render with a channel is only complete when every *writer* goes through
  it.** The close review caught the epic's own regression: `pipe` was a plain field and
  `PagesLifecycleModel` assigned it directly, so the provider badge was missing on every normally
  opened file and appeared only after a Save As. Fixed by making `pipe` an accessor over the channel,
  which removes the class rather than the instance.

**Two live bugs surfaced during verification that the epic exposed rather than caused**, both
pre-existing and both §6.1: the grid's toolbar search not clearing (`|| undefined` erased the
"cleared" signal that three cooperating layers needed) and the script panel's splitter being
unreachable over a Grid editor (a flex item without `min-height: 0` could not shrink below av-grid's
own measured height, so the grid overflowed 162px and buried it). Tracked as US-1108 and US-1110.

**Left deliberately.** `PageToolbar`, `EditorToolbar` and `ContentHostFooter` keep React faces (6, 3
and 1 callers outside the epic); `EditorError.tsx` keeps four; the registry's `View` → `Component`
normalisation shim is still consumed by `ui/app/RenderEditorView.ts`; `applyRestProps`,
`clearRestListeners`, `bindRef` and `fillSlot` all stay. One `as unknown as` survives, in
`isTextFileHost` — a deliberate runtime duck-type probe, now a proper type predicate, whose comment
records that US-559 once silently inverted it. E8 had scheduled the rest-props bridge "to the end,
with `<TextChrome>`"; E9 shows those were never one deadline.

| Task | Title |
|---|---|
| US-1099 | `EditorToolbarView`; delete the dead `AsyncEditor.tsx` |
| US-1100 | `ScriptPanelView` |
| US-1101 | `ContentHostFooterView` |
| US-1102 | `PageToolbarView` and `SwitchWidgetView` |
| US-1103 | `TextChromeView` |
| US-1104 | `markdown`, `html`, `svg`, `log-view` → `View` |
| US-1105 | `notebook`, `mermaid`, `grid` → `View` |
| US-1106 | `env-vars`, `rest-client`, `monaco`, `file-diff` → `View` |
| US-1107 | `graph`, `link-editor`, `draw` → `View`; delete the contract |

## EPIC-066 — [De-React Epic E8: delete the synthetic-event round trip](EPIC-066.md)

The contract was found by search, not inherited: **65 already-vanilla `.ts` files still imported
React**, and **48 of the React symbols they used were event types**. Converted views were typing their
public props with React event types, so a vanilla view wrapped the native event it already had via
`toPublicEvent` and its caller unwrapped it again. **All 27 wrap sites were cast, 17 with the double
`as unknown as`** — the compiler stating outright that the prop type was wrong. Six tasks, all
reviewed.

| Measure | Start | End |
|---|---|---|
| `toPublicEvent` call sites outside `react-compat.ts` | 27 | **0** |
| …using `as unknown as` | 17 | **0** |
| Exported `toPublicEvent` / `PublicEventHandler` | 2 | **0** (module-private) |
| Lossy `nativeEvent as KeyboardEvent`/`as MouseEvent` casts | 11 | **0** |
| `.nativeEvent` read sites | 32 | **1** |
| Dual-armed `"nativeEvent" in e` accessors | 2 | **1** |
| Already-vanilla `.ts` files importing React | 65 | **58** |

**Rule 4 deliberately did not move** (7 roots on a 7-page session): this epic removed event
*translation*, not roots — the root count measures the React that renders, not the React that types.
Verified live on a cold-started app: all nine converted seams deliver a real native event class
(`Dialog`, `Toolbar`, `Textarea` keydown/paste, `ListBox`/`Tree` context menu, `Input`/`Button`
keydown), asserted on `constructor.name`, which the old `Object.create(null)` Proxy could never
report.

Its central finding is a reusable test: **a `mountVanilla` face is not a React implementation.** React
never creates events for a view whose DOM node belongs to a vanilla view, so React event types on such
props are nominal for *every* caller, JSX included — which is what separates a dead dual arm from a
load-bearing one. Three self-corrections are recorded in the epic: the closing property promised to
delete `toPublicEvent`, but `applyRestProps` calls it (E8-13); the task breakdown was mis-cut three
times by directory, costing one red build, before settling on *the connected component of the
prop-type graph* as the atomic unit (E8-8); and E8-11 was stated as an absolute about the app when the
evidence only supported a claim about `uikit/` (E8-14).

- [x] US-1093: Pilot + seam decision — `Textarea`
- [x] US-1094: The React-faced four + all 14 dialog callers
- [x] US-1095: The `onContextMenu` prop chain
- [x] US-1096: `components/tree-provider`
- [x] US-1097: `editors/link-editor` + `ui/sidebar`
- [x] US-1098: Close the round trip

**Left deliberately:** `applyRestProps` / `clearRestListeners` (39/38 files) and `bindRef` (17) — the
JSX rest-props bridge, which goes with `<TextChrome>` at the end of the programme;
`core/events/context-menu.ts`'s dual arm, blocked behind the browser editor and the link-editor React
islands, which still dispatch genuine SyntheticEvents; and the two JSX-free `mountVanilla` faces in
`components/tree-provider`, left for a deliberate sweep of the population EPIC-064 measured rather
than renamed for sitting in a touched folder.

---

## EPIC-065 — [De-React Epic E7: the dialog/popper view registry](EPIC-065.md)

The contract was `core/state/view.tsx`'s `Views.registerView(viewId, React.FC)` /
`renderView(): ReactElement` — a dual-armed registry in exactly EPIC-063's shape, one layer down,
where **14 registrations had already moved to the vanilla arm and 4 had not**. Converting those four
deleted the file entire (`Views`, `View`, `DefaultView`, `IViewRegistration`) and collected a
residual Emotion importer. Five tasks, all reviewed.

**Rule 4: React roots per dialog 10 -> 0** across the four (`EditLinkDialog` 4, the three poppers 2
each), verified live on a restarted app with 0 empty `<svg>`. `theme/GlobalStyles.tsx` is now the
**only non-story Emotion importer in the renderer** — after this, "remove Emotion" is one file.
Non-story `.tsx` 234 -> 229. The surviving types (`IViewData`, `IDialogViewData`, `ViewProps`) moved
into `ui/dialogs/dialog-view-registry.ts`, whose folder already held every consumer, and a missing
native constructor now throws naming the `viewId` instead of silently rendering nothing.

- [x] US-1086: `BrowserDownloadsPopup` -> vanilla (the pilot)
- [x] US-1087: `EditLinkDialog` -> vanilla (model/view split)
- [x] US-1088: `ColumnsOptions` -> vanilla (hosts the data grid)
- [x] US-1089: `CsvOptions` -> vanilla (the only real state migration)
- [x] US-1090: Delete the React arm; relocate the surviving types

Four things it produced that outlast it. **(1)** *A marker is evidence only if it is set exactly when
the thing it marks exists.* The programme's own root-count instrument **over-reports**:
`data-part="react-slot"` is stamped unconditionally by `DialogView` and `TagView` before either picks
its native or React arm, so a host holding plain DOM carries the React marker. `data-react-root` is
authoritative. EPIC-063 added the second marker because a root was *invisible*; this is the same
lesson reversed, and the third instrument correction in the programme. **(2)** *Line count picks the
surface, not the order of tasks within it* — the two largest files here had **zero** React hooks
(all state already in their model, one `.use()` becoming one `bind()`), while the smallest, at a
third the size, carried the epic's only state migration. **(3)** *Whether a cadence change is safe
depends on a property of the value, not of the cadence*: the columns popover went from pushing rows
every render to pushing only on `bind`, which is safe **only** because its accessor returns the
grid's own array, making a re-push an identity no-op — copying it would have discarded in-place cell
edits. **(4)** *A live verification run against a renderer that predates a `.tsx` -> `.ts` rename is
not evidence about the code, and it can hang rather than error* — while `tsc`, lint and the dev
server all stay green. That cost two renderer wedges and a well-argued but wrong defect hypothesis;
a temporary counter in the bind that throws after N invocations and captures the first stacks settled
it in one run.

It also rejected its most plausible rival contract **on a number** rather than on taste:
`trailing?: React.ReactNode` has 5 call sites of which **0 pass JSX** — a dead arm, not a contract —
and recorded that `highlight()`'s React form cannot be collected until `graph` converts, whatever
else happens.

---

## EPIC-064 — [De-React Epic E6: delete the `ReactNode` arm from the uikit icon contract](EPIC-064.md)

The contract was `IconRef = IconName | ReactNode` in `uikit/shared/slots.ts`, with `renderIcon()`
returning a `ReactNode`. Measured live, **44 of the app's 72 React roots (61%) existed only to render
an SVG that already had a DOM builder** — every icon in the app has one. So this epic was a 205-site
call-site migration behind a type narrowing, with **no component converted**: unusual for the
programme, and the best Rule 4 payoff per unit of risk in it. Eight tasks, all reviewed.

**Rule 4: icon React roots 44 -> 0**, verified live on both of the open-epic conditions (browser tab
active and monaco active) and again with freshly opened rest-client, link-editor and graph pages.
Total live roots 72 -> 6; the survivors are the ones the epic named in advance. `icon={<XIcon/>}`
142 -> 0 and `React.createElement(XIcon)` 63 -> 0.

- [x] US-1077: Rule 4 baseline and instrument
- [x] US-1078: Extension hygiene — 26 `.tsx` -> `.ts` renames and 2 committed HMR shims deleted
- [x] US-1079: The 63 `React.createElement(XIcon)` sites in already-vanilla files
- [x] US-1080: uikit internals — the ungated `renderIcon` branches
- [x] US-1081: `editors/` icon sites, part 1 — link-editor, rest-client, graph, git-tree
- [x] US-1082: `editors/` icon sites, part 2 — browser, video, text, settings, html and the rest
- [x] US-1083: `editors/base` chrome and `ui/sidebar` icon values
- [x] US-1084: Narrow `IconRef` to `IconName | Node`; delete `renderIcon`

Four things it produced that outlast it. **(1)** *When a contract changes from a value to a resource,
every cache of that value becomes a bug* — the single-use `Node` hazard hit four times through four
mechanisms (a shared items array, a `useMemo`, a module-scope constant, a story reusing one node),
invisible to `tsc`, lint and the build every time, with the symptom being an icon vanishing *somewhere
other than* the code being changed. **(2)** *A contract can be thinner than its type suggests*:
`renderIcon` went dead without being replaced, because its only job was name -> React element and a
`ReactNode` icon needs no conversion. **(3)** *A `.tsx` count measures "files that could hold JSX",
not React* — 130 of 262 held none and 28 never mentioned React, so earlier epics' progress figures are
overstated. **(4)** An empty `<svg>` on screen is the cheap runtime tell for a migrated site naming an
icon that does not exist, since `createIconElement` falls back to one silently.

It also corrected its own closing property at close (E6-11): `SlotText` does **not** narrow, because
one caller genuinely needs React (the link-editor tooltip). That is the same over-reach E6-1 was
written to catch — predicting a sibling endpoint from an upstream one — this time committed by this
epic's own document. **E7's candidate is measured in advance** (E6-8): `core/state/view.tsx`'s
dialog/popper view registry, dual-armed at 14 vanilla registrations to 4 React, whose conversion
deletes the file entire and collects a residual Emotion importer.

---

## EPIC-063 — [De-React Epic E5: delete the React secondary-view contract](EPIC-063.md)

`ReactSecondaryViewDefinition` in `ui/secondary-views/secondary-view-registry.ts` typed a sidebar
panel as `React.ComponentType`, pinning 13 of the 14 registered panels to React through the registry
rather than through their own content. The registry is now single-armed; `LazySecondaryView.tsx`,
`SideBarPanelHeader.tsx` (with its `createPortal` seam) and `components/icons/EditorIcon.tsx` are
deleted; neither contract file imports React. **Rule 4: sidebar React roots 6 -> 0.**

Two things outlast it. It fixed the programme's Rule 4 *instrument* — a root created by a direct
`mountReactHandle` call was invisible to the `[data-part="react-slot"]` query every earlier count had
used, so a surface hosting a live React subtree could measure zero; `mountReactHandle` now marks its
host `data-react-root`. And it established the standing answer to "convert a component that still has
React callers": **one implementation with the React export reduced to a `mountVanilla` shim**, never
two parallel implementations. Both of its post-close defects (a tree at 100px, labels at 0px) were
inline-style translations that `tsc`, lint, the build and the root count were all blind to.

*(This section was missing: the epic was marked complete and removed from the dashboard, but its
summary was never added here, leaving the roadmap's `[EPIC-063](epics/completed.md)` links pointing at
nothing. Added retrospectively by EPIC-064's close.)*

---
## EPIC-062 — [De-React Epic E4: delete the React `RenderGrid` contract](EPIC-062.md)

The third editor epic scoped by the contract it deletes. `uikit/RenderGrid/` is gone, and with it
the last React virtualization engine: `uikit/VirtualGrid/` (`VirtualGridView`,
`VirtualFlexGridView`) is now the only one. Seven tasks, all reviewed.

- [x] US-1062: LinksList to VirtualGridView (pilot)
- [x] US-1063: `VirtualFlexGridView` — measured-height wrapper over `VirtualGridView`
- [x] US-1068: remove the React roots from `PathInputView`
- [x] US-1064: `NotebookBody` and its cell subtree to `VirtualFlexGrid` (carries Rule 4)
- [x] US-1065: `LogBody` and its cell subtree to `VirtualFlexGrid`
- [x] US-1066: `LinksTiles` to `VirtualGridView`
- [x] US-1067: delete `uikit/RenderGrid/` — the closing property

**An unplanned second closing property.** `RenderGrid.tsx` imported `@emotion/styled` and was the
fourth of the four residual Emotion importers `CLAUDE.md` documented. Three remain. This epic
removed an Emotion importer as well as a grid contract.

**What it cost, and the lesson worth carrying forward — E4-15.** The notebook conversion passed
typecheck, lint, production build, and a scroll-and-geometry battery that found nothing, while the
editor was substantially broken: six user-reported interaction bugs, five of them a behaviour React
supplied implicitly that direct DOM does not and whose absence has **no declaration site**. A dead
`#avg-container` id killed the mouse wheel; `onFocus`/`onBlur` translated to the non-bubbling
`focus`/`blur` broke activation; a sandboxed iframe's focus transition is never announced; a React
component that rendered no DOM became a layout box that collapsed the expanded overlay; and
child-before-parent disposal turned a state capture into a throw that stranded the overlay. A green
build says nothing about any of them. E4-15 is the resulting pre-conversion checklist, now
generalised into `doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md`.

**Two verification lessons, also recorded.** A fixture that cannot trigger the mechanism under test
produces a green result that means nothing — the 17-link tile file fills 4x5 exactly, yields 20px
of scroll, and swept clean while exercising no recycling at all. And an invariant that asserts over
a property the *user* also manipulates will fight the user invisibly: the end-of-paint "the model
wins" scroll rule was sound in argument, cancelled every native scrollbar drag, and no programmatic
probe could ever have reproduced it (E4-13).

---

## EPIC-061 — [De-React Epic E3 — Delete `@monaco-editor/react`](EPIC-061.md)

The second editor epic scoped by the **contract it deletes**, and the first in the programme whose
close is a dependency uninstall. It took every Monaco mount point in the renderer — 13 across 11
files — and put them behind two `VanillaView` hosts the project owns.

**Closing property, delivered:** `@monaco-editor/react` has zero importers in `src/`,
`loader.config({ monaco })` is gone from `api/setup/configure-monaco.ts`, and the package is removed
from `package.json`. `npm ls @monaco-editor/react` returns empty. `monaco-editor` and
`vite-plugin-monaco-editor-esm` stay, and every language, theme, keybinding and IntelliSense concern
`configure-monaco.ts` owns is untouched.

The wrapper was taken **before** the `editors/base` chrome deliberately: each `<Editor>` is a leaf, so
a host plus a thin React face converts it under Rule 1 without touching a parent, and seven of the
eight largest remaining editors mount Monaco. The chrome is the opposite shape and stays last
(EPIC-059 E1-8). With both editor-wide contracts now gone, E4 onward fall back to line count.

**`editors/shared/MonacoEditorHostView.ts`** is new (`monaco.editor.create`); E1's
`MonacoDiffEditorHostView.ts` gained a React face and replace-and-release `setModel`. Kept separate on
purpose (E3-2) — the two editor types and model contracts differ, and a `mode` union would push a
narrowing cast into every call site.

The design work was one decision, **E3-8**: the hosts are *uncontrolled*, so `initialValue` is read
once and external writes go through `setValue` / `setDiffValues`, which own the whole policy —
compare, choose `editor.setValue` when read-only versus `executeEdits` + `pushUndoStop` when not so
the undo stack survives, and suppress the host's own `onChange` with save-and-restore. Eleven
consumers must not each rediscover that; the failure mode is the cursor jumping to the end of the
document while the user types. The mount callback therefore hands back the **host view**, not the raw
editor, since `mountVanilla` gives a React consumer no other way to reach it.

**Rule 4:** wrapper importers **13 → 0** with the package uninstalled, plus `ui/dialogs/TextDialogView.ts`'s
React root **1 → 0** — an already-vanilla view that had been calling `mountReactHandle` purely to render
the wrapper. Structural rather than performance, deliberately: **E3-6 is marked WITHDRAWN** in the epic
doc and kept in full. It had claimed 2 → 0 Monaco constructions per notebook scroll, attributing
measured churn to `MiniTextEditor`'s `key={model.id}`. `renderInfo.ts:314` keys virtualized cells by
row index, so scrolling destroys off-screen rows outright and a vanilla host dies with them — the
target was unreachable. The churn is real, its baseline is recorded, and it belongs to whichever epic
takes the removal ledger's `RenderFlexGrid` entry.

**Twelve `theme="custom-dark"` literals** were deleted rather than ported (E3-4): Monaco themes are
global, so all twelve were the same no-op repeated.

The recurring lesson across three review rounds was one shape — **the two sibling hosts meaning
different things by the same method name**: `setModel` releasing displaced models on one and leaking on
the other, controlled props on one and not the other, echo suppression on one and not the other. Each
was caught by comparing the hosts rather than by reading either alone. The close review's two false
positives had a shape too: both reasoned forward from "`onUpdate` does not reconcile content" without
checking whether the component survives the content change.

Testing owed: **empty**.

---

## EPIC-060 — [De-React Epic E2 — The embeddable bodies](EPIC-060.md)

The first editor-conversion epic, and the first scoped by the **contract it deletes** rather than by
line count. It took the five editors that supply `EditorModule.Body` — the chrome-free body another
editor can embed — so that the React `Body` arm could be removed from the registry. `mermaid` was
already converted in E1; `svg`, `html`, `markdown` and `grid` landed here.

**Closing property, delivered:** `EditorModule.Body?: React.ComponentType` no longer exists in
`editorRegistry.ts`, its EPIC-059 E1-9 normalization shim is deleted, and
`notebook/note-editor/NoteItemActiveEditor.tsx` mounts `mountVanilla(module.BodyView, …)` directly.
Notebook itself stays React — a React parent hosting a vanilla child costs zero roots (E1-8), which is
how a 2,001-line editor avoided being dragged into this epic to delete a type.

The biggest piece was **US-1048**: react-markdown's HAST→JSX step replaced by a hand-written
`hast → DOM` walker (`markdown/hast-dom.ts`), with `code`/`pre`/`img` as mounted vanilla views and
`input`/`a` as rehype HAST rewrites. `MarkdownBlock.tsx` survives as a nine-line `mountVanilla` face
for its four React call sites in `log-view` and `mcp-inspector`. Four transitive packages became
direct (`unified`, `remark-parse`, `remark-rehype`, `property-information`); `hast-util-to-dom` was
deliberately **not** adopted. **`react-markdown` and `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime` now have no importer**
outside one explanatory comment, so both are collectable in Epic F — the packages are still installed.

Every editor's `index.tsx` deliberately stays a React `TextChrome` shell, so the epic reduced the
`<TextChrome>` call-site count by **zero**, by design. The chrome drains in the epic that owns the last
shell.

**Rule 4 — React elements created per markdown render: 254 → 0.** Two measurement lessons, both worth
more than the number. `MutationObserver` **cannot measure a React initial mount** — React 19 assembles
a subtree detached and attaches it once, so an entire markdown render reads as one `addedNodes` entry
and the observer reported 0 mutations inside a 254-element tree. And the first pass mistook
page-manager slot duplication (a retained slot plus a grouped peer) for the renderer rendering twice.
Both errors had the same shape: measuring the page instead of the component.

**Scope shrank once during the epic, on evidence.** `ColumnsOptions` (394 lines) and `CsvOptions`
(107) turned out to be opened from the `grid/index.tsx` toolbar, so they are shell-owned and stay React
until the chrome epic — US-1053 became `GridBody` alone, and the epic's converted surface fell from
1,627 lines to 1,126.

**Reviews found six real problems across the epic**, which is the argument for keeping the plan-review
step un-delegated. Before implementation: an iframe whose `sandbox` would have been set *after*
`mount.tsx` attached the root, allowing one unsandboxed navigation; a queue subscription ordered before
the child its handler touches, where `ComponentQueue.subscribe` drains synchronously; and two
unexamined "is the host null" checks. After implementation: an `iframe.srcdoc` written on every update
— assigning it *navigates*, so the preview reloaded on updates that never touched the content
(**React gave "only write if changed" for free; a vanilla view loses it, and the writes that hurt are
the ones with side effects beyond their value**). At epic close, Codex's `/review` caught child DOM
built in constructors in all five new views, against an explicit rule in `uikit/CLAUDE.md:496-502` —
waved through four times because the E1 template does it too. *A template is not a specification.*

Verified live throughout rather than structurally, after E1's visual round found three defects that
structural checks had passed: geometry assertions (`offsetWidth > 0`) on every converted host in both
the full-page and embedded branches, the fixture's element count against a baseline recorded before
the conversion, scroll position surviving a full re-render, and the embedded path exercised through a
real notebook.

Tasks: US-1051 (svg + html), US-1048 (`hast → DOM` renderer), US-1052 (markdown body), US-1053 (grid
body), US-1054 (delete the `Body` arm). Follow-up: **US-1055** — `MermaidBodyView` carries the same
constructor violation from EPIC-059, left out of scope deliberately.

---

## EPIC-059 — [De-React Epic E1 — Editor foundations](EPIC-059.md)

Built the four seams every later editor conversion needs, each shipped with a consumer that uses it.
The epic existed because **nothing in `editors/` could be converted**: both registries were typed
`React.ComponentType`, `AsyncEditorView` created a React root unconditionally, and the folder held
zero `VanillaView` references.

`EditorModule` became a discriminated union with `View`/`BodyView` arms (31 `Component:` and 5
`Body:` providers unchanged), normalized in `loadModule()` before the cache write so each editor id
keeps one wrapper identity. `MonacoDiffEditorHostView` owns `createDiffEditor` and its models
directly. `editors/shared` lost React in two files. The three chrome shapes are now documented with a
pilot each — chrome-free (`toolset`), `<PageToolbar>` (`image`, 6 editors follow), `TextChrome`
(`mermaid`, 14 follow) — and the secondary-view registry gained `arm: "vanilla"`.

Rule 4: a cold compare-editor mount went **2,001 → 1,096 DOM mutations (−45%)**, plus one React root
deleted. Larger than the working assumption that Monaco's own rendering would swamp the difference —
nearly half the DOM traffic of opening a diff was the React wrapper and its reconciliation.

US-1048 (`hast → DOM` markdown renderer) was **deferred to Epic E2** under E1-5's pre-authorisation,
on evidence rather than caution: no E1 task depended on it, it cannot be split without either
regressing Monaco/mermaid output or mounting a React root per code block, and E2 converts the
markdown editor that owns it. Its plan was written first, so E2 inherits it intact.

Also fixed **US-1049** (found while verifying US-1043): closing one half of a grouped pair threw an
immer `MapSet` error and left the tab orphaned and unclosable.

**Two review rounds, both of which earned their keep.** The epic-close review found two defects the
per-task reviews had missed — `RenderEditorView` retaining a dead editor per editor change, and
`CompareEditor` leaking two Monaco text models per rebind — and its dominant finding generalised a
fix applied in only one place: `VanillaView` had no way to unregister a child, which had produced
**four** leak sites, so the primitive gained `releaseChild()` rather than four hand-patches.

Then the **visual-testing round found four more defects, three of them invisible to the structural
MCP checks that had already passed** — the epic's most transferable lesson:

1. **`loader.config({ monaco })` must stay.** US-1043 deleted it reasoning it "existed only to hand
   the React wrapper the instance" — precisely why 11 remaining wrapper consumers need it. Without
   it the loader falls back to its CDN URL, which Electron resolves as a local file path: every
   Monaco-backed editor hung at "Loading…" with `ENOENT`. The breakage was in the editors US-1043
   *didn't* touch, and none was opened during its verification.
2. **The diff widget collapsed to width 0.** Monaco's `.monaco-diff-editor` sets only `height`
   inline and relies on being a block child; inside the flex host it laid out at 38px/5px — line
   numbers visible, content clipped. The structural check had verified *presence*, never *geometry*.
3. **The `hidden` attribute was inert on every UIKit root** — a class bug, not a mermaid bug. Each
   UIKit CSS sets `display` on its root, and an author `display` rule beats the UA `[hidden]` rule,
   so all ~20 `.hidden =` toggles in converted views were silently doing nothing (the reported
   symptom was a mermaid spinner that never left). Fixed at the primitive: six UIKit stylesheets
   gained a `<root>[hidden] { display: none; }` counter-rule.
4. **`TagsInputView` never mounted its `TagView`s** — latent since Epic C2, not an E1 regression.
   Ownership was claimed and the root inserted, but `TagView` builds all its DOM in `onMount()`, so
   every chip rendered as a bare zero-width span and selecting a tag looked like a no-op. Same class
   as US-1042's `SpacerView` finding. All `claimViewOwnership` sites swept; this was the only miss.

all closed: the `[hidden]` counter-rule and the "ownership does not mount" rule are now stated in

## EPIC-058 — [De-React Epic D — Shell and shared components](EPIC-058.md)

Converted `src/renderer/ui/` (dialogs, secondary views, sidebar, tabs, MainPage) and
`src/renderer/components/` (icons, page-manager, file-search, tree-provider, file-list, file-grid,
git-tree) to vanilla views behind unchanged React-facing signatures, then **flipped the application
root**: `src/renderer.tsx` is now `await bootstrap(); mount(container)`, `createRoot` appears only in
`uikit/shared/mount.tsx`, and the app creates exactly one startup React root — the `GlobalStyles`
Emotion island. Emotion importers went **21 → 4**, each with the owner D6 names; `react-dom/server`
left `src/` entirely; React portal hosts went 4 → 1, kept deliberately as the published
`SecondaryViewProps.headerRef` compatibility arm for 14 editor files; `EditorErrorBoundary` survives
as the epic's one intentional React class component (D5). `#root`'s geometry moved out of Emotion into
a static `theme/root.css` so first-paint layout no longer depends on a React commit.

Rule 4: **207 DOM writes** for a full open+close of the native confirmation dialog (MutationObserver
over `#root` and the overlay layer, stable across runs) — 153 attribute writes against 53 structural
operations. Structure is now cheap; the residual cost is unconditional attribute rewriting at ~74% of
all DOM writes in every subject measured, with a named cause in `applyPanelAttributes`. That is an
Epic E/F optimization target that no build gate or smoke test surfaces.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build-prod` and `git diff --check` passed
throughout. All 13 dialogs were verified to open and dismiss, including Monaco mounting with syntax
highlighting inside a dialog under the vanilla shell. The user verified at the machine what synthetic
events cannot reach: drag-reorder of pinned rows, sidebar folders and tabs, tab drag-out and
drag-between windows, splitter drags, `Ctrl+F` search routing, open animation and first-open focus,
and a cold `npm start`. Epic-level review and both documentation passes completed; the review's one
real finding (a `GitTreeView` repaint guard that could never fire, because `VanillaView.update()`
assigns `this.props` before `onUpdate` runs) was fixed, and its second was reclassified as a
documented trade-off with the follow-up filed as US-1041.

Six defects were found *after* the build gates were green, five of them variations on one hazard: a
React handler closure captures per-render constants, while a vanilla view's fields and per-row records
are mutable and shared with the synchronous notification path. That rule is now recorded in
`doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md`.

## EPIC-057 — [De-React Epic C4 — AVGrid → av-grid](EPIC-057.md)

Replaced the final React grid consumers with the pinned `av-grid@2.2.3` engine through the
`uikit/DataGrid/` boundary, then removed the legacy `uikit/AVGrid/` namespace: 30 files and
4,917 lines, including nine Emotion importers and the final Rule 6 exemption. The dependency,
layered CSS bridge, persisted grid state, context-menu handoff, cell tooltip/ellipsis, Git Tree
renderer, remaining app consumers, and architecture indexes are all aligned to the replacement.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build-prod`, and `git diff --check`
passed. Epic-level review, developer-documentation, and user-documentation checks completed; the
new `GridEditor.ts` non-null assertion found in review was replaced with an explicit lookup guard.
Closure uses current-version verification only: historical comparison and the pre-migration Rule 4
measurement were waived by the user, and Menu behavior was user-tested. The broader consumer smoke
list remains a documented manual follow-up because the live Persephone MCP was unavailable after
the renderer restart.

- [x] US-1019: Adopt av-grid — dependency, `--p-*` bridge, layered CSS, mounting shim, story, and the Rule 4 “before” numbers
- [x] US-1020: `editors/grid/` — the JSON/CSV grid editor
- [x] US-1021: `components/git-tree/` — the commit history grid on av-grid
- [x] US-1024: the cell-overflow tooltip, restored once in `DataGridView`
- [x] US-1022: the four remaining consumers — `FileGrid`, `EnvVarsBody`, `GraphDetailPanel`, `GridOutputView`
- [x] US-1023: Delete `uikit/AVGrid/` and close Epic C

## EPIC-056 — [De-React Epic C3 — Virtualization engine, data views and dropdowns](EPIC-056.md)

Converted the vanilla virtualization engine, data views, and dropdown composites while preserving
their React-facing APIs: `VirtualGrid`, `ListBox`, `Tree`, `MultiListBox`, `Select`, `MultiSelect`,
and `Autocomplete`. The epic recorded the memo-dependency and model-driver rules, removed the C3
effects, drained `Panel` from production `uikit/` consumers, and measured the final Rule 4 search
interaction at 217 raw MutationObserver records (19 in the anchor pane and 198 in the overlay layer).

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed. Epic-level architecture
review, developer-documentation, and user-documentation checks completed; review findings around
vanilla lifecycle guards and native event handling were fixed before closure.

- [x] US-1013: The vanilla virtualization engine — `VirtualGrid`
- [x] US-1014: `ListBox`, `ListItem`, `SectionItem` — the first data view on the vanilla engine
- [x] US-1015: `Tree` — rows, DnD, keyboard, and the largest model in `uikit/`
- [x] US-1016: `MultiListBox` — checkbox rows and the select-all header
- [x] US-1017: `Select` — four effects, async item loading, and the Rule 4 number
- [x] US-1018: `MultiSelect` and `Autocomplete` — the last two dropdowns and `Panel`'s eviction

---

## EPIC-055 — [De-React Epic C2 — Floating layer and composites](EPIC-055.md)

Converted the floating layer and composite UIKit surfaces to vanilla views behind their existing
React-facing APIs: Popover, Menu, Dialog, root-mounted notifications and progress, chrome widgets,
composites, Minimap, and ImageViewport. The epic also completed the UIKit `@floating-ui/dom` move,
exercised the model driver across four models, established native submenu/attachment ownership, and
recorded the final Rule 4 mutation measurement. Menu behavior was smoke-tested in Storybook; the
historical all-React comparison was explicitly waived because closure only required verification of
the new implementation.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed. Epic-level review,
developer-documentation, and user-documentation checks completed; review findings were fixed before
closure. The final Rule 4 Menu-story measurement was 125 raw MutationRecords across the live-preview
and overlay roots (6 + 119) using the pinned observer options.

- [x] US-1005: `Popover` — vanilla floating root on `@floating-ui/dom`
- [x] US-1006: `Menu` and `WithMenu` — `openMenu` attachment and recursive submenus
- [x] US-1007: `Dialog` and `DialogContent` — focus trap and backdrop
- [x] US-1008: `Notification`, `AlertItem`, and `AlertsBar` — vanilla root-mounted alerts
- [x] US-1009: `Progress` — `ProgressOverlay`, its first story, and `Panel`'s eviction
- [x] US-1010: `Toolbar`, `Splitter`, `Breadcrumb`, `CollapsiblePanelStack` — vanilla chrome
- [x] US-1011: `SplitButton`, `TagsInput`, `DateInput`, `CategoryList`
- [x] US-1012: `Minimap` and `ImageViewport` — canvas views and their first stories

## EPIC-054 — [De-React Epic C1 — Foundation and primitives](EPIC-054.md)

Established the foundation for converting UIKit components from React to direct DOM ownership
behind unchanged React-facing APIs. The epic closed the `uikit/` import boundary, added vanilla
view lifecycle and React-compatibility contracts, introduced layered component CSS and the DOM
icon path, moved Tooltip to a framework-neutral attachment, and converted the C1 component set:
Button, IconButton, TruncatedText, SegmentedControl, the stateless leaves, Checkbox, Slider,
RadioGroup, Input, Textarea, and Panel's styling surface. Storybook and running-app smoke checks
covered the converted component paths and representative editor/shell callers; no intended
user-facing workflow change was introduced.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed. Epic-level review,
developer-documentation, and user-documentation checks completed. The review's two Tooltip
non-null assertions were fixed before closure; no other implementation blockers remained.

- [x] US-995: Rule 6 — close the `uikit/` → app-layer imports and lint the boundary
- [x] US-996: The vanilla UIKit contracts — CSS, slots, React-compat helpers, Rule 4 baseline
- [x] US-997: DOM icon path — rewrite the 116 icon bodies as markup; dual-face factories
- [x] US-998: `Tooltip` — attachment-based, on `@floating-ui/dom`
- [x] US-999: `Button`, `IconButton`, `TruncatedText`, `SegmentedControl` + the Rule 4 after-number
- [x] US-1000: `Text` and the stateless leaves — `Label`, `Tag`, `SelectableRow`, `Divider`, `Dot`, `Spacer`, `Spinner`, `ProgressBar`
- [x] US-1001: `Checkbox`, `Slider`, `RadioGroup`
- [x] US-1002: `Input` and `Textarea`
- [x] US-1003: `Panel` — Emotion to CSS, no vanilla face

## EPIC-053 — [De-React Epic B — The reactive foundation and the boundary](EPIC-053.md)

Established the framework-neutral reactive foundation and the React/vanilla boundary: zustand was
removed from the state layer; vanilla view ownership, binding, keyed DOM reconciliation, subtree
swapping, model drivers, and two-way mount adapters were added; and the Storybook PathInput pilot
converted one UIKit component end to end behind its unchanged React-facing API. The pilot also
validated nested React ownership, portal disposal, controlled updates, keyboard and mouse behavior,
and the co-located CSS path. No user-facing documentation change was warranted.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --cached --check` passed. The
converted Storybook PathInput produced 3 MutationObserver records for one ArrowDown with its
popover open under the documented observer options and reset point. Epic-level review,
developer-documentation, and user-documentation checks completed.

## EPIC-052 — [De-React Epic A — Style and token foundation](EPIC-052.md)

Established the styling and token foundation for the de-React roadmap: durable Emotion and
inline-style inventories, CSS custom properties for UIKit tokens, shared theme state and color
resolution, Emotion-to-CSS conventions, and a completed Spinner CSS pilot. The public board theme
contract and existing user workflows remain unchanged.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed. Epic-level review,
developer documentation, and user-documentation checks completed; no user-facing documentation
change was warranted.

- [x] US-980: Relocate the Emotion and inline-style inventories
- [x] US-981: Emit `uikit/tokens.ts` as CSS custom properties
- [x] US-982: One theme state and one color resolver

## EPIC-051 — [De-React Epic P — Preparation (React-side)](EPIC-051.md)

Completed the React-side preparation work for the de-React roadmap. UIKit, shell, and coupled
component slots now use neutral icon names and text types; local model-owned state, imperative
handles, contexts, and effects were moved to explicit model boundaries; ordinary DOM refs use
React 19 ref props; body overlays share one host; and the Emotion and inline-style surfaces were
inventoried for Epic A. The epic remains React-only and introduces no user-facing workflow change.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed. Epic-level review,
developer documentation, and user-documentation checks completed; no user-facing documentation
change was warranted.

## EPIC-050 — [Folder-content view — multiselect and drag-and-drop](EPIC-050.md)

Brought the folder page — the `CategoryEditor` / `CategoryView` pair that opens when a folder is clicked in the Explorer panel — up to the parity EPIC-049 gave the tree beside it. It is the Explorer's "list pane", and it was the poor relation: one row selectable, every action singular, and nothing draggable in or out. Dropping files from Windows Explorer onto it did not file them into the open folder at all; the window-level fallback in `GlobalEventService` opened them as tabs. The feasibility work found the same shape EPIC-049 found: the set-shaped operations all existed, but they were keyed on tree nodes. Crucially the four drop actions read only **two** things from a node — a target directory path and a display title — so they were *target-shaped, not tree-shaped*, and could be lifted into a shared module behind a `DropTarget` of `{ path, title }` with the tree keeping a thin node→target adapter. That observation is what made the extraction a standalone task rather than a copy.

Range selection was **easier** here than in the tree, and worth recording as the counterexample to EPIC-049's central tension. `Tree` had to own Shift+click ranges because only it knew the flat visible row order, which collided with UIKit Rule 2. In this view the visible order *is* `filteredItems`, which the model already holds — so the model computes ranges itself, the list and tile components stay dumb (render from a set, forward the click event), and no protocol was needed. The lesson is that Rule 2's tension was never about ranges; it was about a primitive that owns layout the consumer can't see.

Three of the epic's edits were made only because a "no behavior change" claim was checked mechanically rather than by reading. The extraction was verified by pulling every user-visible string literal out of `git show HEAD:TreeProviderViewModel.tsx` and out of the new modules and diffing the two sets — all differences were interpolation-variable renames producing identical output. And returning `boolean` from the new `deleteItemsBatch` would have *changed* behavior: for a single item it would have reported success, making the tree clear its selection and re-list a second time, neither of which happens today. It returns `"none" | "single" | "batch"` so the caller's existing per-item path stays untouched. One pre-existing bug found during the extraction was deliberately **preserved and backlogged** rather than fixed — in a link-collection provider, a drag of only directories leaves `moveItemsInto` with nothing to move, so it returns `false` and the caller never re-lists. Fixing it inside a no-behavior-change refactor would have made the refactor unreviewable.

Selection revealed two ordering traps. Because `selectedIds` *replaces* `selectedId` rather than supplementing it, the initially-selected row painted nothing until the seed ran on first render too, not only on external change — and the seed then has to skip when the primary is already in the set, or Ctrl-deselecting the primary snaps it back. Separately, Ctrl+click must **append** to the set rather than rebuild it from the visible order: rebuilding silently drops hrefs hidden by the search filter, and those must survive so clearing the search brings them back highlighted. Set order carries no meaning here, which is what makes appending safe. A third trap was `this.isFirstUse` read *inside* the deferred callback, where both lifecycle flags have already been reset — it has to be captured first.

Drag-and-drop was shaped almost entirely by one browser constraint: **Chrome's protected mode releases only `dataTransfer.types` during `dragenter`/`dragover`**, never the payload. So the planned per-row `canDrop(item, payload)` at hover time is impossible, and the design split into a type-level `acceptsDrag(dataTransfer)` at hover plus a payload-level `canDropOn(item, payload)` at drop. Every check that needs the actual items — above all "is this folder inside the set being dragged" — therefore fails at drop time with a message rather than by refusing the hover. That is now written into `trait-system.md`, because it is a property of the platform, not of this view.

The whitespace-versus-row highlight was solved without stopping propagation on enter/leave: rows let those events bubble so the view's own drag-enter counter stays positive for the entire time the drag is inside it, and whitespace paints only when "inside the view AND no row targeted". The counter is keyed per target rather than tracked with a boolean because child elements fire spurious `dragleave`; the spec's ordering (dragenter on the new target before dragleave on the old) is what keeps the root counter off zero when crossing between rows. Only `drop` stops propagation — and it must, for whitespace drops as much as row drops, or dropping into the open folder *also* opens every file as a tab.

Two items were cut during implementation rather than shipped. `ListItem`'s new drop highlight lost to the focused-selection override, which is more specific by one attribute; rather than an `!important`, the override's own `rowMatch` was narrowed with `:not([data-drop-active])` at the source, which is inert for every existing consumer and makes the two rules mutually exclusive by construction. And a plural trait-drag payload prop was written for the list components, then **removed as dead code**: the native-drag override is gated to the file provider and returns `true` for every draggable row there, so the trait payload is only reachable when nothing is draggable. The tree needs both paths only because it also serves Mneme and link-collection providers. Nothing dims during a drag-out either, and that is not an omission — `webContents.startDrag` takes over the gesture, so no `dragend` ever reaches the row and any dim would risk sticking.

A late unplanned task closed the asymmetry that testing exposed: a drop made in the folder page refreshed the tree, but a move made in the tree left the folder page stale. The tree had had live refresh all along through an opt-in, duck-typed `provider.watch` — deliberately not on `ITreeProvider` — and the folder page simply never subscribed. Subscribing was ~15 lines, and it came free for Mneme folder pages (an agent writing a note now shows up) and link categories. It needed no care over flicker or stale selections only because `loadItems` already gated the loading placeholder on an empty listing and already re-validated the selection against the new listing.

The review's one must-fix had nothing to do with the feature. `CategoryViewModel.tsx` contained a raw NUL byte in a string literal where an escape sequence was intended, which made **git treat the whole file as binary** — losing line-level diff and blame from that commit onward. It had been visible for two tasks as a `binary file matches` notice from a grep and was read past. The fix also removed the reason for the sentinel: the drag-enter counter is now keyed `string | null` with `null` meaning the view itself, so no "impossible href" has to be manufactured and the question of whether a path could collide with it does not arise. Multi-select, drops and drag-out are gated on one helper (`supportsMultiSelect` → `type === "file"`), so the archive, Mneme, Link-collection and Boards folder pages and the Links editor's own list and tile views are untouched; widening is a one-line change.

## EPIC-049 — [Explorer file-tree multiselect](EPIC-049.md)

Gave the Explorer panel's file tree a real multi-selection — Ctrl+click, Shift+click, `Ctrl+A`, and Shift with the arrow/Home/End/Page keys — so every action it already offered now works on a set: Copy Paths, Cut/Copy to the Windows clipboard, Delete, dragging out to Windows Explorer or Teams, dragging into a Links page or another Persephone window, and moving by drop inside the tree. The feasibility work found that almost none of this was an I/O problem: `clipboardWriteFilePaths`, `startOsFileDrag`, `copyPathsInto`, `LinkDragData.items` and the provider `importFiles`/`importLinks`/`moveToCategory` entry points were **already plural** and were being handed one-element arrays. The single-item restriction lived in exactly two places — the UIKit `Tree` primitive and `TreeProviderViewModel.selectedValue: string | null` — plus one genuine gap: the file-provider branch of `moveItems` was gated on `remaining.length === 1`, so a multi-item internal move silently did nothing. The selection **visuals** needed no work at all, because the focus-aware selection contract is pure CSS keyed off each row's own `[data-selected]`; N rows paint correctly and `[data-active]` stays singular, which is exactly Explorer's "many selected, one focused".

The design tension worth recording is that range selection is defined over the *flat visible row order*, which only the Tree knows, while UIKit Rule 2 forbids a primitive owning its primary value. The resolution: the Tree stores **no** selection. It reads the current set back through the consumer's existing `isSelected` predicate, one call per visible row, computes the result of the gesture, and emits it through a new `onSelectionChange`; the consumer stores it and keeps painting through `isSelected`. The only thing the Tree retains is a transient **anchor**, stored by row *value* rather than index so it survives a re-list. Testing `shiftKey` before `ctrlKey` made Ctrl+Shift+click a range extend with no extra branch. That pattern is now written into Rule 2 itself, because the rule as stated read as forbidding it.

Two user decisions shaped behavior more than the mechanics did. **Nested selections are pruned before every operation, not just on-disk ones** — a folder and a file inside it are one operation input, the folder — which matters most for the payloads that leave the app: handing Windows three overlapping paths would make Explorer copy the inner files twice. One shared helper does the pruning at each action's entry point, and its consequence is deliberate and visible: the count in a menu label or confirm is the *pruned* count, so a folder plus two files inside it deletes as "1 item" while three rows stay highlighted. **Only visible rows may stay selected** — collapsing a folder deselects everything under it, so the user always sees the whole selection and nothing hides in a closed folder. That one also resolves a latent inconsistency rather than adding a rule: `buildTree` re-lists children only for expanded paths, so a selection surviving a collapse would have referenced nodes absent from the tree data, and would have been silently dropped at action time. The prune is scoped to explicit collapse gestures and deliberately **not** wired into `buildTree`, where it would race the reveal path — navigation sets the selection to a file moments before its ancestors are expanded.

The implementation's own surprises were in restore and in drag feedback. Persistence was planned as verify-only, but the first-use seed preferred the incoming `selectedHref` whenever it was set — and the Explorer *always* sets it from its own navigation state on restart, so the persisted plural set would never have been read; the rule now restores the set when it is consistent with the navigated file and lets navigation win otherwise. Pre-epic state carrying only a single href still restores as a one-item selection. On the drag side, `webContents.startDrag` renders the icon of the first path only and Electron exposes no way to compose a count badge, so a multi-file drag looks like a single-file drag while in flight — accepted and documented rather than worked around. Two limits are worth knowing for future work: the "can't drop a folder into itself" guard suppresses the drop highlight for in-process trait drags only, because a native OS drag exposes no paths during `dragover`, so for the Explorer that guard lands at drop time as a warning; and the primary row that `Ctrl+V` targets is the bottom-most selected row rather than literally the last-clicked one, since the Tree emits sets in visible order. Multiselect is an **opt-in prop** passed by `ExplorerSecondaryView` alone — the Mneme, Archive, Links, Script-library, Boards and Menu Bar trees take the single-element path unchanged, and the non-file provider with a `rename` (Mneme) keeps its own provider-level single-item move. Reviewed at epic level: no must-fix findings.

## EPIC-048 — [Persephone UI Guidance for Agents](EPIC-048.md)

Gave an agent connected over MCP the ability to *explain* Persephone, not just drive it. An agent could already snapshot the app window and click it; nothing told it what the header's glyph does, what the corner indicators are, or which of the 32 editors exists — so "where do I change the language of this tab?" got an answer reverse-engineered from a DOM dump, if at all. Two new guides fix that (`read_guide("ui")` for the chrome, `read_guide("ui-editors")` for the catalog), plus a **highlight overlay** so the agent can point at an element instead of describing it.

The epic introduced **no new addressing scheme**: `data-name` was already the convention across ~65 files, so the work was completing coverage on the shell (14 attributes added, nothing renamed) and writing it down as a contract in `doc/architecture/ui-element-contract.md` — a `data-name` quoted in a guide is agent-facing API, and renaming one is a documentation change. Live verification earned its keep three times over facts that would have shipped a wrong guide: `tab-language` does not exist on `noLanguage` editors, a **pinned tab renders no title text** (so titles must come from `list_pages`), and `[data-name="menu-bar"]` is always in the DOM (`display: none` when closed), so its presence says nothing about whether the menu is open.

The overlay (`assets/agent/ui-highlight.js`) is one dependency-free module serving two callers — `app.ui.highlightElement()` in the app window, the same file pasted into `browser_evaluate` for boards. Its look is **fixed in every theme by design**, not by limitation: a callout styled to match the surrounding theme is indistinguishable from Persephone's own UI, and the user must be able to tell an agent placed it. That rules out reading a board's `--p-*` tokens and is a documented exception to the no-hardcoded-colors rule. Two implementation findings: `app-asset://` maps the URL's **host** to a directory, so a top-level asset has no reachable URL; and detach-only removal was insufficient, because Persephone hides the Menu Bar with `display: none` rather than unmounting — the first version left a ring floating over empty space in the single most likely flow. Removal is now visibility-based.

Reviewing the highlight recipe corrected a security claim carried since epic creation: `app-asset:` is unreachable from web pages **not** because of `BLOCKED_PROTOCOLS` — that guards only `will-navigate` and would not stop a `fetch` — but because the protocol handler is registered on two sessions that browser pages are not in. Verified live from an `https://` origin (fetch, XHR, `<script src>`, `<iframe src>` all fail). Left standing, someone could have deleted the entry as redundant or trusted it to stop a fetch. Consequently **browser-page highlighting is documented as unsupported**, with a plain-border fallback, rather than as a nice-to-have.

A late task covered the case the guides all assume away — a **fresh install with MCP off and an agent that has never heard of Persephone**. The obvious plan died on investigation (nothing auto-loads an install directory into an agent's context), but `extraResources` already ships every guide to `resources/assets`, so they are readable with no MCP and no network; `build/README.txt` mainly exists to say so. The real blocker was that settings edited on disk *looked* like they worked: `_onChanged` fired only from `set()`, so an external edit flipped `mcp.enabled` and the Settings toggle while the server stayed down. `loadSettings` now diffs and emits on watcher reloads only — the initial load must not, or startup starts MCP and Mneme twice. That made every window actuate global settings, which the audit showed was already true at startup and safe, but it did surface a genuine race: `startMcpHttpServer` guarded on a variable assigned inside the `listen` callback, so two callers both reached `listen()` on the same port.

QA against Haiku produced the epic's most transferable lesson. Six of nine scenarios passed; the three failures had nothing in common except that **no guide was read**, though each guide held the answer. Strengthening the routing instruction was tried and verified live — and changed nothing, because instructions are part of what gets skipped. What did work was **naming the thing precisely**: "language" can read as UI locale, document language, or Monaco's syntax mode, and clarifying it to "the Monaco syntax-highlighting mode" took one case from 42 tool calls without opening a guide to 15 with the guide read first. The same test passes first try on Sonnet. So ambiguity, not indifference, is what sends a weak model exploring — and exploring is expensive, since it improvises against live state (one run closed the user's tab while guessing). The structural remedy for genuinely unambiguous cases is backlogged.

## EPIC-047 — [Move the PDF Viewer to a Published Board](EPIC-047.md)

Moved PDF viewing out of the installer and into the published-boards catalog, deleting the built-in `pdf-view` editor and the **21 MB** of vendored pdf.js it served (`assets/pdfjs/`) — a payload every user downloaded whether or not they ever opened a PDF, and almost entirely third-party code, since the built-in viewer was a thin `<object>` around pdf.js's own stock `viewer.html`. The replacement `pdf-viewer` board hosts that **same unmodified stock viewer** in a nested same-origin iframe, so the UI users see is unchanged (search, thumbnails, outline, zoom/fit, rotate, text layer, print, Save-as) at a ~3.5 MB opt-in download, and pdf.js security fixes now arrive as board updates rather than app releases. The gating risk was the board sandbox: no catalog board had ever used a Worker, WebAssembly, or a nested iframe under `BOARD_CSP`. Rather than spike it with a throwaway, the v1 board *was* the spike — it found that `frame-src` and `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` were blocked while the Worker had been permitted all along (`worker-src` falls back through `child-src` to `script-src 'self'`), so `BOARD_CSP` gained `frame-src 'self'`, an explicit `worker-src 'self'`, and `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` — all same-origin, admitting no remote content.

The hard part was **non-local sources**: archive-embedded and `http(s)` PDFs had to keep working, and the epic first planned a mirrored read-only `editorKind: "binary-host"` modeled on the text content host. Investigation superseded that twice over. A simple custom-editor board already receives the page's live content pipe (it was disposing it unread), and `IContentHost.content` is a `string`, so a binary variant would have been parallel code rather than reuse. What shipped instead is much smaller: **`getFilePath()` always resolves to a readable LOCAL path** — a plain local file returns its own path with no I/O, anything else is materialized from the pipe into a memoized read-only cache file — plus one declarative manifest gate, **`editorSources: "local" | "any"`**, because the resolver refuses a non-local source to a simple board *before* any board code runs and so could not be an opt-in-by-calling API. Default-closed deliberately: boards reading via `readFile` would break on those sources, and the failure is invisible to an author who only tests local files. The payoff is that the board carries **no source-specific code at all** — one code path proven live across a local file, `pdfs.zip!sample.pdf`, and a remote `https` PDF. Two further resolution gates surfaced during implementation that the investigation had missed (the Layer 2 file resolver skipped the merged resolver for a non-local url; the http resolver picks its editor from a hardcoded table), the latter fixed narrowly so a board may override the table's editor but the table still decides browser-vs-content. Parity was confirmed against the built-in viewer over a written checklist before anything was deleted, including the two items that were open questions rather than expectations — print and Save-as from inside a `board://` frame both work with no bridge support.

Removal was deliberately last, and several degradations were accepted rather than papered over with permanent compat code: a persisted `pdf-view` tab is dropped on the one upgrade that removes the editor, a saved link with `target: "pdf-view"` gets no remap, and the `"pdf-view"` scripting/MCP editor id is removed with no alias. The one place that did earn new logic is remote-URL routing, where the http extension table doubles as the browser-vs-content decision: `.pdf` keeps an entry carrying `browserFallback: true` with no editor, so a claiming board still wins and, without one, Chromium's own viewer renders it in a browser tab. `safe-file://` — a privileged scheme that existed solely to feed pdf.js — came out with it. The board's `editorPriority` stays at the published 200 (nothing built-in claims `.pdf` any more, so it has no tie to lose); the drop to 100 is ladder hygiene staged unreleased, avoiding a version bump and a `minAppVersion` constraint for a change no user could observe. Reviewed at epic level with no must-fix findings.

## EPIC-046 — [Board Environment Variables](EPIC-046.md)

Gave boards a first-class way to store secrets (connection strings, API keys, passwords) **outside** the board folder, so copying, sharing, or committing a board never leaks them. A single, user-configured `.env.json` file (`board-vars.file` setting) holds a `namespace → profile → key → value` schema and is optionally password-encrypted by reusing Persephone's existing file-encryption mechanism (`shell.encryption`/`ui.password`/`TextFileModel.decrypt`) — deliberately **not** OS-bound (`safeStorage`/DPAPI), which breaks on non-persistent pooled VMs. A session-singleton `BoardEnvStore` (`api/board-vars/`) models the encrypted-file access flow directly on the existing `BrowserBookmarks` pattern (load → detect encryption → prompt once per session → session-unlocked). Each board's namespace is its manifest's **`author`/`name`** when both are explicitly set, else its root path — stable across a board's dev-repo copy and its installed copy, with a non-blocking advisory dialog at registration time when two boards' computed namespaces collide. Boards read/write only their own namespace via a new bridge API, **`persephone.var.get/set/list/show`**, routed through `board-vars-bridge.ts` with requests serialized on a shared chain so concurrent boards can't each pop a dialog at once — `BoardWebview` resolves the namespace itself from the calling board's root, so a board can never name or reach another board's slice. A new built-in editor (`env-vars-view`, `*.env.json`) gives users a namespace-list + profile-tabs + AVGrid review/edit view (plain text, no masking — simpler than the originally-designed reveal-toggle and unnecessary for a file already kept outside the shareable board folder), reachable from Settings or `persephone.var.show()`. Finally, an agent-facing admin surface, **`app.boardVars`** (`get`/`set`/`list`/`listNamespaces`/`namespaceFor`/`show`), gives scripts unrestricted namespace access — unlike the board-side bridge, deliberately not namespace-locked, since `execute_script` already carries full app trust equal to `app.fs`/`app.settings` — so an agent can provision a freshly-scaffolded board's secrets in the same script that created it. Reviewed at epic level — one must-fix (`app.boardVars.show()` with no namespace could resolve to the wrong editor if the configured file didn't literally end in `.env.json`; fixed to force the `env-vars-view` editor explicitly) plus a stale inline type widened for accuracy.

## EPIC-045 — [Published Boards Catalog](EPIC-045.md)

Let users **discover and install boards the project publishes** — custom editors, viewers, and tools — from inside Persephone, without leaving the file they're opening. A public GitHub repo (`andriy-viyatyk/persephone-boards`) is the catalog: `main` carries a `boards-manifest.json` describing every published board, and each board version is a per-board GitHub **Release** ZIP asset. A main-process **catalog service** (`published-boards-service.ts`, mirroring `version-service`) fetches the raw manifest on a 24h gate, caches the last-good copy for offline use, and broadcasts changes; a **download service** (`board-download-service.ts`) streams each release ZIP with an incremental **sha256** verify. Installation is deliberately **two consented steps** that keep the "nothing is trusted without the user's dialog click" invariant intact: **Download** (byte-progress, checksum-verified, extracted locally — trusts *nothing*; the board sits inert on disk, reviewable by the user or their AI agent) and **Register board** (the standard `showTrustBoardDialog` — only then does the normal custom-editor machinery pick the board up). Opening a file whose type has no installed editor but matches a published board shows a **`+` entry** in the editor switch (`Text | +`) that maps to a real registered **Board Info editor** (`editors/board-info/`) — a host-capable holder (adopts/yields `CONTENT_HOST_TRAIT` without rendering) so `Text ↔ + ↔ board` switches transfer the content host losslessly. The Board Info editor serves both **install mode** (Download → Register, multi-match tiles) and **properties mode** (info, an on-demand version history for **update/rollback** via a safe temp-extract + folder-swap that never destroys a working board, Uninstall/Unregister, Open board). Updates surface **silently** — an "Update available" badge in the Tools & Editors → Boards tab (context-menu Update) and a dot on the in-board Properties button; the swap is guarded by an open-pages/busy precondition with a "Close pages & continue" shortcut. A board's `standalone` bit (derived: no masks → standalone; masks → opt-in) drives **pin gating** (only standalone boards are pinnable), and per-version **`minAppVersion`** compatibility hides/refuses versions an older app can't run while keeping older compatible versions installable. The **`app.boards`** script API gained a full lifecycle + catalog surface (`registerBoard`/`unregisterBoard`/`renameBoard`; `searchPublished`/`getPublishedVersions`/`downloadPublished`/`installPublished`/`uninstallBoard`/`checkPublishedUpdates`) under the request-vs-grant model — an agent can drive discover → download → review → register → update/rollback → uninstall with at most one dialog click per privilege step. A new full-page **Tools & Editors hub** (`editors/tools-hub/`, a singleton page) is the page-sized counterpart of the sidebar panel (opened via its "Open in new tab" button); its **Search boards** tab is the sole catalog-browsing surface (browse/filter/install without a matching file open + Refresh catalog), and the panel and hub share extracted components (`PinnedRail`, `BuiltinEditorsList`, the trusted-boards/tools lists). The About page's "Check for Updates" now also force-refreshes the catalog and shows an "Available boards" count. Publishing is a version bump + merge to `main`: a **GitHub Action** (`persephone-boards` repo) zips each board, creates the tagged release, and rewrites both catalog manifests with no manual steps — validated end-to-end by publishing `drawio-viewer` v1.0.0 from the live catalog. Reviewed at epic level — one must-fix hardened (a catalog `id` charset guard + a path-containment check close a catalog-driven path-traversal vector) plus a `formatBytes` de-duplication; security invariant verified to hold on every trust-adjacent path.

## EPIC-044 — [Board Secondary Views](EPIC-044.md)

Added the last piece that lets a **Board** stand in for a full built-in editor: a board can now contribute one or more **secondary (sidebar) views** — a second board-relative `.html` rendered in its own sidebar panel and wired to the *same* board model as the main view — closing the gap that kept editors like Todo (a main list + a coordinated "Lists/Tags" sidebar panel) from moving out of Persephone's core and into boards. A board declares views in `board-manifest.json` (**`secondaryViews: [{ id, html?, title? }]`**, read by a `fileMasks`-independent reader) and/or replaces them at runtime with **`persephone.setSecondaryViews([...])`**; each declared view maps to a stable panel-id family **`board-secondary:<viewId>`** that the secondary-view registry resolves — via a new **`registerPrefix`** — to a single generic **`BoardSecondaryView`** component. Frames stay synchronized through a new **`persephone.state.*`** shared-state channel (`init`/`get`/`set`/`merge`/`onChange`) injected into **every** board frame, authoritative on the Persephone side (`BoardEditorState.sharedState` on the base `BoardEditorModel`, so *every* board gets it), with writes round-tripped through the host and ordered by a monotonic `sharedStateSeq` guard, and **opt-in persistence** — only keys declared via `state.init(defaults, { restorableKeys })` are written to the page descriptor, so large/transient state never bloats the open-pages file. Each frame learns its role synchronously at boot via **`persephone.view`** (`"main"` or the view id, delivered on a `view=` URL param) so one HTML file can encapsulate every view. The second iframe reuses `BoardWebview` with `entry` + **`isMain`** props: because all frames share one `model.id`, only the main frame owns the automation target / CDP registration / ui.log reset / autofocus, and **job reaping is per-sink** (a secondary frame's teardown reaps only its own `boardId`, never the shared owner) — so closing a secondary panel never tree-kills the main frame's processes or breaks its automation. Board panels die on navigate-away (Pattern A); busy-board re-promotion re-derives them. The **proving ground** is the built-in Todo reimplemented as a **content-host board with a Lists/Tags secondary view** (selection→filter coordinated purely through `persephone.state.*`, file content through `persephone.host.*`), authored outside the repo (`C:\projects\persephone-boards\todo`) and registered **alongside** the built-in Todo as an A/B test — the built-in editor is untouched. **US-858** lifts the v1 main-frame-only automation limit by mapping each board frame onto the `IBrowserTarget` **tab** abstraction (frames-as-tabs): `browser_tabs` lists them, `select` opens+activates the sidebar panel, and each frame registers for CDP under its own `${model.id}/${tab}` key. Authoring the Todo board surfaced a reliability inventory (**US-859**) that drove two hardening tasks: **US-860** made `persephone.host.getContent`/`getLanguage` **await the handshake internally** (safe in any call order — the editor-switch empty-render trap is gone, no ready-gate needed), made `setContent` read-your-own-write, added a **generation-counter guard** to `customEditorRegistry.refresh()` (a stale overlapping refresh from a rapid untrust+trust board-folder rename can no longer clobber the newer result), and delegated `BoardContentEditorModel.modified` to its host so a dirty content-host board reports correctly in `list_pages` / the tab dot; **US-861** mirrors board-frame `console.error`/`console.warn` to the board's `ui.log` (new `board:log` message) and made **`board_refresh` deterministic** (awaits the remounted main frame's load + CDP re-registration via `waitForFrameLoad`, returns `frameReady`) so a snapshot right after a refresh can't hit the stale pre-reload frame. Reviewed at epic level — clean, no architecture or coding-standard violations.

## EPIC-043 — [Content-Host Boards](EPIC-043.md)

Delivered EPIC-042's explicitly-deferred content-host variant: a custom-editor **Board can now let Persephone own the file it edits**, the same way every built-in editor does. A board declares **`editorKind: "content-host"`** in `board-manifest.json` (vs. the default `"simple"`, which is EPIC-042's direct-`filePath` behavior); Persephone then builds the board **with an `IContentHost`** — the exact `TextFileModel` that backs Monaco/Grid/Notebook — so it keeps the content pipe (`file://` / `https://` / archive providers), encoding detection, encryption, the auto-save cache, dirty/modified tracking, the tab's unsaved dot, the "save changes?" release prompt, and Ctrl+S. The board works with the content through an injected **`persephone.host.*`** bridge (`getContent` / `setContent` / `onContentChange` / `getLanguage` / `save`). The model is a new subclass **`BoardContentEditorModel extends BoardEditorModel`** (composing the host via `CONTENT_HOST_TRAIT`, template `MonacoEditor`) that inherits all board machinery (iframe/trust/toolbar/automation/icon) unchanged and adds only the host composition — so plain boards are untouched. Because the host is shared, a content-host board **switches with Monaco/Grid by transferring the same host** (no reload, no data loss) in both directions, and — unlike the simple board — works over **non-local files** (`https://`, inside archives, encrypted) since Persephone owns the pipe. Construction/switch/persistence branch on the kind (`PagesLifecycleModel`, `PageModel.switchMainEditor` both directions, and a `PagesPersistenceModel.restorePage` board branch placed before the generic `if (d.host)` so a restored content-host board rebuilds the subclass + host); all three `isPlainLocalPath` gates are lifted by kind. The content bridge rides a net-new renderer→iframe push (`host:content`, echo-guarded) plus a new shim inbound handler, and the shim injects an automatic `window`-level Ctrl+S (opt-out via `preventDefault`) so saving needs zero board code; content-host boards support no busy retention (the host transfers out on switch). Two custom-editor polish items shipped alongside: a simple custom-editor board now shows the **file name** (not the board name) in its tab, and a file claimed by a trusted custom-editor board shows that **board's icon** in the Explorer tree / file lists / tabs (the board icon wins over the language icon when the board is the file's default editor — e.g. `.drawio` shows the drawio-viewer icon). The **DrawIO viewer board** (authored in the external boards repo, not bundled) was converted from simple to content-host as the proving ground: it renders `.drawio` XML via `host.getContent()`/`onContentChange()`, the user edits the raw XML in Monaco (host transfers on switch), switches back to see the updated diagram, and Ctrl+S saves. Reviewed at epic level — clean, no must-fix concerns (the sanctioned `components/icons` → `editors/board` icon import was recorded in the dependency rules).

## EPIC-042 — [Boards as Custom Editors](EPIC-042.md)

Closed the last gap between a Board and a first-class editor: a **trusted** board can now register itself as the editor for a file type, appearing in the page's **editor switch** next to the built-in editor (Monaco/Grid/…) and — when it outranks the built-in — becoming the default open target. A board declares the association in `board-manifest.json`: **`fileMasks`** (glob masks matched against the file basename, e.g. `*.drawio`, `*.grid.json`), **`editorPriority`** (its slot on the existing resolution ladder — monaco 0 / grid 20 / draw 50 / viewers 100 / category 200; strictly-greater wins, built-ins win ties), and **`editorName`** (switch-widget label). The fields are honored only when the board is trusted. Board editors are runtime-discovered, so they live in a **separate reactive `customEditorRegistry`** (never mutated into the static `editorRegistry`) keyed by the virtual id **`board-editor:<boardRoot>`**; `resolveEditorIdForFile` merges built-in + board candidates at the two file-open decision points (direct open + `openRawLink` file resolver), gated to real local files only (`isPlainLocalPath`). An untrust drops associations live (no filesystem watcher). Switching to a board reuses navigation's unsaved-changes guard (`confirmRelease()` — Save/Don't Save/Cancel; cancel aborts, staying on the built-in) and rebuilds through `createEditorFromFile` in both directions (no shared content host); a board's `editorId` is dynamic while acting as a custom editor but `getRestoreData()` pins `"board-view"` for persistence, and MCP/automation detection broadened via `isBoardEditorId`. The file path reaches the board as the async bridge method **`persephone.getFilePath()`** (delivered through `ILinkData.filePath` → `BoardEditorState.filePath` → `BoardPortInitMsg`), which the board reads/writes with the existing `persephone.readFile()`/`writeFile()` — the simple direct-`filePath` case (the content-host variant reusing Persephone's content pipe is deferred to a successor epic). The **DrawIO viewer board** (authored in a separate external boards repo, not bundled) is the proving ground — a read-only `.drawio` (diagrams.net) viewer that validated the whole path end-to-end and retired the built-in DrawIO-viewer plan. Its authoring surfaced and fixed two plumbing gaps (the render-path `board-editor:<root>` → `board-view` module mapping in `RenderEditor`, and reusing `SwitchWidget` in `BoardToolbar` so the switch-back UI shows while on a board).

## EPIC-041 — [Unified Focused/Unfocused List Selection](EPIC-041.md)

Spread the Explorer file-tree's **two-state selection** to every selectable list in the app: a selected/hovered row is subtle **gray** (`background.light` / `background.message`) when its list is **not** focused, and **blue** (`background.treeSelection`) with a **blue outline** (`border.active`) when the list **is** focused. Previously this behavior lived only inside the `Tree` primitive, reachable only via `keyboardNav`, while every other list hand-rolled its own selection with a different token and no focused-vs-unfocused distinction. The mechanism is pure CSS — `:focus-within` gated by a container `data-focus-selection` attribute + a focusable (`tabIndex=0`) container, **no JS focus state**. US-829 extracted the visuals into one shared contract (`uikit/shared/selection-style.ts` — `rowSelectionBase` on the row, `focusSelectionOverride` on descendant-row containers, `rowFocusSelectionOverride` on standalone rows), refactored `Tree`/`TreeItem` onto it with **zero visual change** (Explorer is the live regression guard), and added `ListItem`/`ListBox` `selectionStyle="focus"` + a `Tree` `focusSelection` opt-in, decoupling focus-styling from `keyboardNav`. US-830 flipped the already-shared-primitive consumers (Rest Client tree, Notebook Categories via `focusSelection`; MCP Tools, Storybook, Links list-mode + pinned via `selectionStyle="focus"`) — the blue focused override moved to a **row-hosted** rule so a standalone `ListItem` (outside `ListBox`) is self-contained and its container needs only `data-focus-selection` + `tabIndex=0`. US-831 retrofitted the five hand-rolled surfaces (App menu `FolderItem`, Notebook Tags, ToDo, MCP Resources, Links Tags/Hostnames — the last two gaining a real selected background, replacing today's text-only blue) via a new minimal UIKit **`SelectableRow`** primitive — the Rule-7-clean home for the focus CSS that editor code (no Emotion) can't express inline. **No new color tokens, no theme edits.** Reviewed at epic level — clean, no architecture/standards violations.

## EPIC-040 — [Dependency & Platform Updates (Keep Persephone Current)](EPIC-040.md)

A housekeeping cycle to pull Persephone's runtime and key libraries current so it never drifts into an unupdatable state (stale Chromium = site breakage; stale toolchains = painful multi-major migrations later). Each bump was isolated to its own task and verified against the surfaces it could affect, so any regression stays attributable. Landed: **Electron 39 → 43** (Castlabs `+wvcus` fork — Chromium 150 / Node 24, Widevine DRM + VMP signing preserved; also fixed an Electron-43 cross-origin regression by enabling `corsEnabled` on the `app-asset://` scheme), a **safe batch** of minor/patch npm bumps, **`@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.86 → 0.111** (no code change — narrow, stable Messages-API slice), **`monaco-editor` 0.52 → 0.55** (top-level `monaco.typescript`/`monaco.css` namespace move; upstream menu-paste bug patched), the **ESLint flat-config migration** (eslint 9 + `@typescript-eslint` 8 + react-hooks 7), **Vite 5 → 8** (rolldown) with **Electron Forge fully removed** — dev now runs on an own `scripts/dev.mjs` (renderer dev server + HMR + watch-built main/preload/board-shim + Electron restart), prod on `scripts/build-prod.mjs`; and the last deferred majors **`csv-parse` 6 → 7** and **`picomatch` 2 → 4** (both verified behavior-identical against their sole consumers). Fuses were dropped with Forge (never actually applied in shipped builds; re-adding via an electron-builder `afterPack` hook is an optional hardening follow-up in the backlog). Reviewed at epic level — clean, no architecture/standards violations. **US-826 (TypeScript 5.9 → 7.0)** was deferred to the backlog: TS 7 is the native Go compiler with no JS API, and typescript-eslint peer-caps `typescript` `<6.1.0`. Residual release-time QA (DRM playback in a signed build + packaged installer) is tracked in the backlog for the next signed build.

- [x] US-821: Update Electron to 43.0.0 (Castlabs +wvcus) — residual signed-build DRM/installer QA in backlog

## EPIC-038 — [Agent Tools Registry](EPIC-038.md)

Added an **Agent Tools registry** — Persephone's *executable memory*, complementing Mneme's *knowledge* memory. An agent (or user) turns a working integration script into a persistent, reusable **tool**: a folder (a *toolset*) holding a `tools-manifest.json` declaring one or more tools plus scripts in **any language**, an optional `.env` for secrets, and an optional `README`. Once registered, any MCP-connected agent discovers tools with **`search_tools`** (Claude-Code-`ToolSearch`-style — matches return complete, ready-to-call definitions) and runs them with **`execute_tool`** (args delivered as JSON on **stdin**, results returned via a `##PERSEPHONE_RESULT##<json>` sentinel line — last-wins so noisy stdout is harmless; failures carry `stderr` + `exitCode` + `toolsetRoot` so the agent fixes the tool rather than working around it). The MCP surface is **constant-size** regardless of how many tools exist (`search_tools` / `execute_tool` / `refresh_toolset` / `create_toolset`) — deliberately *not* dynamic first-class tools, to avoid per-session schema bloat and flaky `listChanged` support. The design mirrors the Boards subsystem end-to-end: folder + manifest identity (`tools-manifest.ts`), a **user-only trust registry** (`tools-trust.ts` / `trustedTools.txt`, exact-path match — registration ≡ trust, never stored in the manifest, never exposed on `app`/scripts so a script can't self-register or self-execute), a reactive enumeration model (`registered-tools.ts`), template scaffolding (`tool-template/` + `tool-scaffold.ts`), and the command-runner execution engine (`tool-executor.ts` — cwd = toolset root, `.env` injection, `timeoutMs` tree-kill, self-rotating per-toolset `tools-execution.log`). Every agent-initiated registration (`create_toolset`, or registering a copied folder) is gated by a **"Register this toolset?"** confirmation dialog — a deliberate divergence from boards' auto-trust, because a registered tool later runs headlessly on every call. Management UI (US-805, re-scoped from a standalone list editor): registered toolsets surface on the two boards panels (an Explorer-sibling **Boards/Tools** switch + a third **Tools** segment in the global Tools & Editors panel), a lightweight **per-toolset editor** (`persephone-toolset://`, `toolset-view`) shows manifest info + tool list + execution log, and `tools-manifest.json` gets a register-gated **Open Toolset** icon in the Explorer tree. Toolsets are **portable** — self-contained relative-path folders with a `requirements` field for provisioning a new machine. Reviewed at epic level (close-out review clean; two optional correctness fixes applied — removed an unused icon; corrected an empty-`.env` doc claim).

- [x] US-801: Toolset package format + registry (`tools-manifest.json`, `toolsTrust`, `registeredTools` model)
- [x] US-802: Execution engine (stdin-JSON args, `.env` secrets, timeout, output contract, in-memory stats + self-rotating per-toolset log)
- [x] US-803: MCP surface (`search_tools` full-definition results / `execute_tool` / `refresh_toolset` + `mcp-res-tools.md` guide + instructions; `create_toolset` deferred to US-804)

## EPIC-037 — [Migrate Board `<webview>` → `<iframe>`](EPIC-037.md)

Replaced the board host `<webview>` tag with an in-DOM **cross-origin `<iframe src="board://<host>/index.html">`**, eliminating the tag's guaranteed per-open cold start (fresh out-of-process renderer + ephemeral partition + an async `registerBoardProtocol` round-trip before navigation — ~0.5–2 s) so a board now opens **instantly, like any built-in editor**. The trusted-code threat model justifies the move: a board is local, user-authorized, extension-like code (it can already `execute()` arbitrary processes), so SOP + `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames: false` + the served CSP is adequate isolation, and the in-DOM iframe composes naturally under all host overlays (the reason `WebContentsView` was rejected). Each board loads a **distinct `board://<host>`** origin (a stable hash of the board root minted by `registerBoard` in main), giving per-board storage isolation without separate session partitions; the `board://` handler moved from per-partition to a **single host-routed** handler on the shared session. The privileged bridge left the (now-deleted) `preload-board.ts` for a **`MessagePort` RPC**: main mints a `MessageChannelMain` port pair per board, the renderer brokers a one-time handshake transferring `port1` into the frame (`targetOrigin: "board://<host>"`), then the board talks **directly** to a main-process handler over the duplex port (`execute` streaming, dialogs, files, links, notify, theme push). The `window.persephone` surface is rebuilt by a browser-IIFE shim (`board-shim.ts`) the handler inlines into served HTML before the first author script. Automation (`browser_*`) was re-pointed below the frozen `IBrowserTarget` seam to target the board **frame** via CDP (`BoardTargetModel` + `cdp-service` `registerBoardFrame`), so the agent contract is byte-for-byte unchanged. The redundant open-time auto-reload (the "blink") was removed — manual **Reload** + a new **`board_refresh`** MCP tool replace it. Load failures funnel into the board's `ui.log` from four detectors (main `did-fail-load` + 404 logging; shim `securitypolicyviolation`, `window.onerror`/`unhandledrejection`; handshake watchdog). A go/no-go gate (US-775) confirmed the dramatic open-latency win before the bridge/automation rewrites committed; a live POC (US-776) de-risked the cross-origin port transfer + streaming end-to-end first. Reviewed at epic level (close-out fixed 2 concerns: `</script` escaping of the inlined shim source; a minimal `BoardEditorModel.dispose()` to clear the live iframe ref + frame CDP registration).

- [x] US-769: Remove board auto-reload (blink fix); keep manual Reload; add `board_refresh` MCP tool
- [x] US-770: `<iframe>` host (no `sandbox` attr) + cross-origin `board://<host>` loading; host-routed handler; host CSP fix

## EPIC-036 — [Boards: Explorer-integrated switcher & in-board chrome](EPIC-036.md)

Reoriented Boards around the **Explorer root** instead of around `.persephone`. Introduced a single reusable, fully-expanded **`BoardsTree`** (folders compacted VSCode-style; pure `boards-tree-build.ts`) rendered everywhere boards are listed: a new **Explorer-sibling "Boards" panel** (`BoardsSecondaryView`, backed by `ExplorerEditor` exactly like Search, scoped to the Explorer root), the global **"Tools & Editors → Custom Boards & Editors"** tab (retrofitted onto the same tree, multi-root), and an **in-board toolbar** switcher popover. A new **Create-board dialog** (folder picker defaulting to the Explorer root + name + live target-location label) replaced the old name-only prompt. The **`.persephone` project mode was removed entirely** — the `persephone-folder://` scheme, the project Board editor's board-list view (`BoardListSecondaryView`), and the Explorer "Create .persephone project" / "Trust all boards" affordances are gone; `BoardEditorModel` is now single-board only, and a `.persephone` folder is an ordinary folder. An open board gained a Persephone **`BoardToolbar`** (Reload, Show-log, full board path → switcher popover, and a File Explorer button that opens the sidebar Explorer rooted at the board's parent folder); the switcher's scope rides a new persisted `ILinkData.explorerRoot` captured at open. Trust became **hierarchical** (`board-trust` is ancestor-aware, outer wins) so a board nested in a trusted folder is auto-trusted and the registry never holds a nested pair. Reviewed at epic level (close-out review clean — no concerns). Follow-on polish: `BoardsTree` hover-row highlight + a reusable `TreeItem` `trailingVisibility` opt-in.

- [x] US-759: `BoardsTree` component — single reusable fully-expanded boards tree (single-root + multi-root)
- [x] US-760: "Create board" dialog — folder picker + name + computed location

## EPIC-035 — [Boards Anywhere — portable boards, manifest identity, board-level trust, link/MCP open & sidebar registry](EPIC-035.md)

Generalized EPIC-034's Web Boards from "a board lives inside a `.persephone` project" into **portable, first-class custom tools**. A board is now identified by a **`board-manifest.json`** at its root (descriptive metadata only — no trust or behavior fields) and can live **anywhere on disk**; `.persephone/boards/` stays as the default create location. Trust moved from per-project to **per-board** — a path-keyed registry (`board-trust.ts` / `trustedBoards.txt`) that is also the **known-boards registry** (trusted ≡ registered); trust is never read from the manifest, foreign boards prompt a "Trust board" dialog, and boards Persephone creates are auto-trusted at creation. Boards open through a new **`persephone-board://`** in-app link scheme routed via `openRawLink` (parser-only, sibling of `persephone-folder://`). A board lifecycle API (**`app.boards`** — `createBoard`/`createDemoBoard`/`openBoard` + `app.openRawLink`) plus **`create_board`/`open_board` MCP tools** and a `read_guide("boards")` agent guide let an agent stand up and develop a board end-to-end with no user clicks. The **Explorer** adds an "Open Board" trailing button on `board-manifest.json` rows (row click still opens the JSON), and the sidebar **"Tools & Editors"** panel gained a **"Custom Boards & Editors"** tab listing trusted boards grouped by folder — boards are pinnable alongside built-in editors (unified `PinnedRef` over the `pinned-editors` setting) and pinned boards appear in the add-page dropdown. Reviewed at epic level (close-out fixed 2 concerns: stale board files in `folder-structure.md`; `app.ui.notify` vs the `ui` singleton). The Custom Editor axis (file-extension routing, file-as-input) is deferred to a successor epic.

## EPIC-034 — [Web Board — HTML-page board with `persephone.execute` + board scripts](EPIC-034.md)

Added **Web Boards**: small local apps whose UI is a plain HTML page the user owns, hosted in a **sandboxed `<webview>`** (sandbox + contextIsolation on, nodeIntegration off, CSP forbidding remote network) served over a per-partition **`board://`** protocol, with a single injected `window.persephone` bridge. The bridge's one method, **`execute()`**, streams a real OS process spawned in the main process (a shared **command runner** — `runner-channels.ts` + `app.proc` — with whole-tree kill and per-owner reaping), plus an integration tier (`notify`, `openRawLink`, native file dialogs) and a live **`--p-*` theme contract** (CSS variables + JS mirror with `onThemeChange`). Boards live under a project's **`.persephone/boards/<Name>/`** behind a **per-project trust gate** (RCE-explicit confirmation; an untrusted project won't render). The **Board editor** (Pattern B, survive-navigation) provides a sidebar board list + main management surface with create/delete, "Create Demo board", per-board custom icons, `ui.log`, and live reload; a **"Create .persephone project"** Explorer context menu bootstraps a project. Boards are authored and debugged by an **AI agent over MCP** — they are first-class **`browser_*` automation targets** (the automation layer duck-types `editorId`, pulling no editor module into its bundle). Shipped a recommended-components catalog under **`boards-assets/`** (`manifest.json` + 9 component skins + a no-dependency native `<dialog>` pattern) and a living, self-documenting **demo board** (`assets/demo-board/`). Reviewed at epic level (close-out fixed 4 concerns: automation static-import isolation, board view/factory split, proc-contract drift guard, async `fs.append`).

## EPIC-032 — [Mneme — Wiki / Vector Memory service](EPIC-032.md)

Built **Mneme**, a standalone Rust knowledge-base service that turns any folder of Markdown into a locally-indexed, searchable **vector memory** (SQLite FTS5 + `sqlite-vec`, on-device int8 ONNX embedding via `ort`), exposing hybrid full-text + semantic search and file-like read/write/edit/glob/grep tools over MCP. Integrated into Persephone end-to-end: a single shared auto-reconnecting MCP client with resource-subscription live-refresh, a `MnemeProvider` (read/write/edit), an Explorer-like tree sidebar with create/rename/delete + OS and cross-root drag-drop, a root search view (markdown-rendered results, tag/date filters), a config & monitoring editor (roots, include/ignore, reindex progress, model download/inventory, log), a Settings toggle with sidecar auto-launch, a tri-state header indicator, and first-run routing to download the model. Inference is **CPU-only** (DirectML/GPU benchmarked and removed). Shipped via electron-builder `extraFiles` (`mneme.exe`, ONNX statically linked, no bundled DLLs); the ~357 MB embedding model is a **separate GitHub release** (`mneme-models-v1`) downloaded on first use.

## EPIC-031 — [Git Functionality Enhancements (incremental)](EPIC-031.md)

Grew git from the read-only v1 (EPIC-030) into day-to-day tooling, built incrementally — one user-requested increment at a time, with a **per-task** review model (not the deferred epic-level pass). Delivered: a **"Changes" panel** (working-tree status → stage / unstage / reset → **commit** via a Commit dialog with editable author + branch), a **"Branches & Tags" panel** (browse, switch, create branch, click-to-reveal in the graph), **Push** and **Pull** (Git-Extensions-style split-button; shared fetch / ahead-behind / `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` fail-fast auth foundation; never force-pushes), a Git Tree **bottom panel** (Commit + Diff tabs), **auto-refresh** (recursive watcher + `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`), persisted grid column layout, File Diff compare-commits improvements, and a new UIKit **`SplitButton`**. All mutating ops stay behind the off-by-default "Git integration" setting and degrade gracefully. Small one-off tweaks were logged in the rolling **US-625** (batch-reviewed 2026-06-10). Close-out: all tasks reviewed per-task — no outstanding review at close. Future git work will be filed as separate tasks/epics.

## EPIC-030 — [Git Integration — Git Tree + File Diff editors](EPIC-030.md)

Read-first git tooling, v1. Git access via **simple-git** in the main process (`git-service.ts` + `git-ipc.ts`), exposed to the renderer through a settings-gated, directory-cached API (`api/git.ts`). A new **"Git integration" setting** (off by default) gates everything — when off, zero git activity. Git membership is detected **once on the shared `TextFileModel` host** (`gitRepo` via `rev-parse`), so every text editor inherits the **"Git Diff" switch** with no per-editor code. Two new registered editors: a **Git Tree** editor (opened from the `.git` node in Explorer — branch/commit history on `AVGrid` + an SVG `BranchTreeCell` painting a ported VS Code MIT swimlane layout, paginated via the editor-owned `GitTreeModel`), and a **File Diff** editor (host-adopting, Monaco side-by-side diff with `from`/`to` revision pickers that reuse the Git Tree component in a popover; the Unstaged side is editable and writes back). v1 is strictly read/inspect — no mutating git operations. Close-out: `/review`, `/document`, `/userdoc` run as a single deferred pass over US-610–US-613. **Review disposition:** the `styled.*` usage in `components/git-tree/` was flagged against `coding-style.md:109` but **accepted** as consistent with existing `components/` precedent (`tree-provider/`, `file-search/`, `icons/`); the rule was left unchanged.

## EPIC-029 — [Standalone PageNavigator → `SecondaryViews`, a reusable panel host](EPIC-029.md)

Renamed `PageNavigator` → `SecondaryViews` family and turned the component controlled (`views` + `ISecondaryViewsState` + `setState` props — no longer bound to `PageModel`). Widened `editor.page` from the concrete `PageModel` to a new `IPageHost` interface; `BrowserPanelHost` is the second implementer, hosting the bookmarks sidebar inside the Browser empty page and drawer. The `secondaryEditor` field renamed `secondaryView` everywhere, including persisted state. Link Editor panels became always-open (no close affordance, no duplicate in-view panels). Notebook, Todo, and Rest Client moved their bespoke splitter side-panel layouts into `SecondaryViews`. The stale `editors/base/IPageHost.ts` stub (deleted in US-607) was removed; `IPageHost` now lives at `api/pages/IPageHost.ts`. Close-out: `/review` (US-607), `/document` (US-608), `/userdoc` (US-609).

- **Phase 1a — Foundation**
- [x] US-595: Rename `secondaryEditor`→`secondaryView` + `PageNavigator`→`SecondaryViews` family
- [x] US-596: `ISecondaryViewsState` + controlled `SecondaryViews` component
- [x] US-597: `IPageHost` typing for `editor.page` (+ derived `isMain`)
- **Phase 1b — Per-editor adoption**
- [x] US-598: Explorer — adopt + verify under new infra
- [x] US-599: Archive — adopt + verify under new infra
- [x] US-600: Links — finalize `IPageHost` membership + `isMain`
- [x] US-600-a: Links — always-on `SecondaryViews`, drop in-view panels, unify Category click
- **Phase 2 — Browser**
- [x] US-601: Browser adopts `SecondaryViews` in its empty page + bookmarks drawer
- **Phase 3 — Remaining editors**
- [x] US-602: Notebook → `SecondaryViews`
- [x] US-603: Todo → `SecondaryViews`
- [x] US-604: Rest Client → `SecondaryViews`
- **Phase 4 — Close-out**
- [x] US-607: Epic close-out — `/review` (code audit vs architecture docs)
- [x] US-608: Epic close-out — `/document` (dev docs in `/doc/`)
- [x] US-609: Epic close-out — `/userdoc` (user docs in `/docs/`)

## EPIC-028 — [Unified Editor Architecture — Editors as Standalone Models](EPIC-028.md)

Single-hierarchy editor rewrite via strangler-fig migration over 37 tasks. All 22 editors became top-level `EditorModel` subclasses; text-bearing editors share `IContentHost`; owner-orchestrated switching via `CONTENT_HOST_TRAIT`. The `ContentViewModel` subsystem and the `EditorView` type alias are gone. Major version bump 3.0.10 → 4.0.1. Task folders and the `EPIC-028-editor-architecture/` design folder (walkthroughs, mockups, concerns log) were deleted on close — the per-task READMEs and walkthroughs were in-flight implementation contracts, not enduring reference material. The architectural outcome is captured in `/doc/architecture/editors.md` and the EPIC-028.md doc above. `/review`, `/document`, `/userdoc` skipped per user direction (US-583 / US-584 / US-585 already refreshed the dev-doc and user-doc surfaces).

- **Phase A — Foundation**
- [x] US-547: Foundation primitives — `EditorModel`, `IContentHost`, `ComponentQueue`, `TOneState` selector subscribe, new `editorRegistry`, `PageDescriptor` v4 types, `CONTENT_HOST_TRAIT` (inert)
- [x] US-548: PageModel adapter layer — unified `editors[]` + `_mainEditorId`; `LegacyEditorAdapter`; persistence dual-reads (v3 or v4) writes v4; `compareGroups` to `PagesModel.state`
- [x] US-549: Shared chrome — `PageToolbar` + `TextChrome`; NavPanel button auto-renders for sidebar editors; portal refs retired
- **Phase B — Cross-cutting**
- [x] US-550: MCP + scripting facades partial — `mcp-handler.ts` MI1–MI5; `page.asX()` gains `force?: boolean`; `PageWrapper.type` retired
- **Phase C — Per-editor migrations**
- [x] US-551: Monaco / Text editor migration — `MonacoEditor` v4 class + `<MonacoBody>`; `CONTENT_HOST_TRAIT` + cross-camp switch
- [x] US-552: Grid editor migration — 3 registry ids collapsed into 1 class with `format`
- [x] US-552-B: Host-managed editor view state — generic `getEditorState`/`setEditorState` on `IContentHost`; HS1 pattern established
- [x] US-553: LogView editor migration — `LogViewEditor` over `TextFileModel` host; cleanup of `acquireViewModelSync` callsites
- [x] US-554: Markdown editor migration — search + compact-mode + scroll machinery
- [x] US-560: Svg editor migration — baseline Tier-5 template
- [x] US-561: Html editor migration — identity-only state slice
- [x] US-562: Mermaid editor migration — async render + lightMode HS1
- [x] US-564: Graph editor migration — six owned submodels relocated; canvas-ref bridge
- [x] US-565: Draw editor migration — bidirectional Excalidraw payload loop; HS1 darkMode
- [x] US-555: Link editor migration — first sidebar-owning Tier-5; `beforeNavigateAway` + `onMainEditorChanged` first exercises
- [x] US-556: Todo editor migration — first non-sidebar-owning Tier-5 since Draw
- [x] US-563: Rest Client editor migration — `RestClientShared` extraction; response-cache split-by-scale
- [x] US-557: Notebook editor migration — outer-only scope; inner per-note deferred to US-579
- [x] US-558: Browser editor migration — first no-host v4 editor; first to embed another v4 EditorModel (drawer LinkEditor)
- [x] US-566: Compare editor migration — verification pass (zero source changes; landed in US-548 + US-549)
- [x] US-567: Explorer editor migration — first secondary-only `EditorModel` v4 native
- [x] US-568: PDF editor migration — generic v4-native no-host restore branch (`V4_NO_HOST_EDITOR_IDS`) + `wrapLegacyForPage` early-return for v4 instances
- [x] US-569: Image editor migration — dual-resource lifecycle (blob URL + cache file)
- [x] US-570: Archive editor migration — first no-host sidebar-owning v4 editor; completes EX8 `instanceof` chain
- [x] US-571: Video editor migration — streaming-server session lifecycle + VLC integration; `PageToolbar.noSpacer` opt-in
- [x] US-572: Settings editor migration — simplest no-host (identity-only state)
- [x] US-573: About editor migration — near-clone of Settings
- [x] US-574: MCP Inspector editor migration — most stateful no-host; mechanically the Video pattern in place
- [x] US-575: Storybook editor migration — singleton with persisted UI state
- [x] US-576: Category editor migration — only tree-provider consumer; closes walkthrough-30
- **Phase D — Cleanup**
- [x] US-581: Native v4 editor registry — internalize matching + retire legacy-registry dependency
- [x] US-579: Notebook inner per-note migration — embedded v4 `EditorModel` instances per note via duck-typed `NoteItemEditModel` host
- [x] US-559: Strangler-fig retirement — delete `LegacyEditorAdapter` + content-view subsystem + dual-read persistence; fold legacy `EditorModel` base into `TextFileModel`; bump 3.0.10 → 4.0.1
- [x] US-582: Post-strangler cleanup — drop `V4` prefix, fold `editors/base/v4/*` up, strip EPIC-028 narrative across ~135 files
- [x] US-583: EPIC-028 documentation audit + punch list — 72 files audited, 20 changes identified, U1/U2/U3 user-locked
- [x] US-584: Dev-doc refresh for EPIC-028 close-out — 9 architecture files updated, `editor-guide.md` rewritten, `CLAUDE.md` Key Files refreshed, 5 diagrams rewritten + 2 retired
- [x] US-585: User-doc + QA sweep for EPIC-028 close-out — `page.md` + `editors.md` + `whats-new.md` v4.0.1 section; 37 spot-check files clean

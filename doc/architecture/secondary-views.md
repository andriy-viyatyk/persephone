# Secondary Editor System

How sidebar panels work in Persephone. Covers registration, lifecycle hooks, navigation survival, rendering, persistence, and how to add new secondary views.

**Source code:** [`PageModel.ts`](../../src/renderer/api/pages/PageModel.ts), [`EditorModel.ts`](../../src/renderer/editors/base/EditorModel.ts), [`SecondaryViewsView.ts`](../../src/renderer/ui/secondary-views/SecondaryViewsView.ts), and the native secondary-view registry.

---

## Overview

PageModel holds a `secondaryViews[]` array of EditorModel instances that appear as sidebar panels in SecondaryViews. Secondary views can be separate models (like ExplorerEditorModel) or the mainEditor itself (like ArchiveEditorModel when browsing an archive).

```
PageModel (one per tab)
  ├── mainEditor: EditorModel              // primary content area
  ├── secondaryViews: EditorModel[]      // sidebar panels
  │   ├── ExplorerEditorModel              // Pattern A: separate model
  │   └── ArchiveEditorModel ←── same as mainEditor  // Pattern B: mainEditor as secondary
  ├── secondaryViewsModel                   // sidebar layout: open/close/width
  ├── activePanel: string                  // which panel is expanded
  └── expandPanel(panelId)                 // expand a specific panel
```

---

## 1. Core Mechanism — the `secondaryView` setter

The `secondaryView` getter/setter on EditorModel manages `PageModel.secondaryViews[]` membership automatically. It is `string[] | undefined` — one model can register multiple sidebar panels:

```typescript
// Setting adds the model to page.secondaryViews[]
model.secondaryView = ["archive-tree"];       // one panel
model.secondaryView = ["explorer", "search"]; // multiple panels

// Clearing removes the model (without disposing it)
model.secondaryView = undefined;
```

**Internally**, the setter calls `this.page?.addSecondaryView(this)` or `this.page?.removeSecondaryViewWithoutDispose(this)`. This is the ONLY way models should register/unregister themselves.

---

## 2. Two Registration Patterns

### Pattern A: Separate model (ExplorerEditorModel)

A dedicated EditorModel subclass that is ONLY a secondary view — never becomes mainEditor.

```
PageModel
  ├── mainEditor: TextFileModel
  └── secondaryViews: [ExplorerEditorModel]  // separate instance
```

- Created by `PageModel.createExplorer(rootPath)` or during restore
- Survives navigation — `beforeNavigateAway()` never clears (Explorer is always present)
- Disposed when user closes the panel or the page closes
- The **only** panel that passes `multiSelect` to `TreeProviderView` (the folder page it navigates
  to is multi-selectable too, but independently — see §12): Ctrl/Shift+click
  builds a set that copy/cut/delete/drag act on. The plural set lives in the tree view model and is
  persisted inside `treeState.selectedHrefs`; `selectionState.selectedHref` stays single — it is the
  one-way "the main editor navigated here" channel, and adopting it collapses the set to that row.
  Layer-3 context-menu items are singular, so `handleContextMenu` bails out when its `selection`
  argument holds more than one item

### Pattern B: mainEditor as secondary (ArchiveEditorModel)

The mainEditor registers itself in `secondaryViews[]` simultaneously. The same model instance is both `page.mainEditor` and in `page.secondaryViews[]`.

```
PageModel
  ├── mainEditor: ArchiveEditorModel ←─── same instance
  └── secondaryViews: [ExplorerEditorModel, ArchiveEditorModel ←─── same instance]
```

- ArchiveEditorModel sets `this.secondaryView = ["archive-tree"]` in `restore()` or `setPage()`
- When user navigates to a file inside the archive, ArchiveEditorModel becomes a secondary view:
  - `beforeNavigateAway(newEditor)` checks `newEditor.sourceLink?.sourceId === this.id`
  - If the new file was opened from this archive → keeps `secondaryView` → **survives as secondary**
  - `setMainEditor()` checks `survivesAsSecondary = secondaryViews.includes(oldEditor)` — if true, old editor is NOT disposed
- When user navigates to an unrelated file → `beforeNavigateAway()` clears `secondaryView` → removed from sidebar → disposed

**This pattern is designed into PageModel** — `setMainEditor()` explicitly handles it.

---

## 3. Lifecycle Hooks

EditorModel provides lifecycle hooks that PageModel calls at specific moments:

| Hook | Called by | When | Base behavior | Override for |
|------|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `setPage(page)` | `addSecondaryView()`, `setMainEditor()` | Model attached to / detached from a page | Stores reference | Registration (e.g., ArchiveEditorModel sets `secondaryView` here) |
| `beforeNavigateAway(newEditor)` | `setMainEditor()` | Old mainEditor is about to be replaced | Clears `secondaryView` (remove self) | Conditional survival (check `newEditor.sourceLink`) |
| `onMainEditorChanged(newMainEditor)` | `notifyMainEditorChanged()` | After mainEditor was replaced | No-op | Respond to new content: highlight file in tree, clear selection, or remove self |
| `onPanelExpanded(panelId)` | `setActivePanel()` | A panel belonging to this model was expanded | No-op | Deferred reveal (scroll to highlighted item); sync derived state from the active panel |

`onPanelExpanded` runs on the **model**, so it fires whenever the active panel changes —
regardless of whether the editor's main-view component is mounted. Prefer it over a
view-level subscription for any state that must stay in sync while the editor is demoted to a
sidebar (its main view unmounts then). For example, the Link editor maps the expanded panel
(Collections / Tags / Hostnames) to its current filter + breadcrumb here, so switching panels
keeps working after navigating away to one of its links.

---

## 4. Navigation Flow

When user navigates to a new file (`navigatePageTo()`):

```
1. page.setMainEditor(newEditor)
   ├── oldEditor.beforeNavigateAway(newEditor)
   │   ├── Base: this.secondaryView = undefined  → removed from sidebar
   │   └── Override (ArchiveEditorModel): keep if newEditor is from this archive
   │
   ├── survivesAsSecondary = secondaryViews.includes(oldEditor)
   │   ├── true  → oldEditor stays alive (no dispose, no setPage(null))
   │   └── false → oldEditor.setPage(null), deferred dispose
   │
   ├── this._mainEditor = newEditor
   ├── newEditor.setPage(this)
   │
   ├── notifyMainEditorChanged()
   │   ├── For each secondary view: m.onMainEditorChanged(newMainEditor)
   │   │   └── ArchiveEditorModel: checks sourceId, clears if unrelated → dispose
   │   │   └── ExplorerEditorModel: updates highlight, never clears
   │   └── Cleanup: remove & dispose models that cleared their secondaryView
   │
   └── Register new editor's secondary panel if newEditor.secondaryView is set
```

---

## 4b. Promote / Demote Flow

A secondary view can be toggled into the main editor role (and back) via `promoteSecondaryToMain(model)`:

**Promote** (secondary → main):
```
1. page.promoteSecondaryToMain(model)  // model is in secondaryViews[], not mainEditor
   └── page.setMainEditor(model)       // standard navigation lifecycle
       ├── oldEditor.beforeNavigateAway(model)
       │   └── base: this.secondaryView = undefined → removed from sidebar → disposed
       ├── model becomes mainEditor AND stays in secondaryViews[] (Pattern B)
       ├── notifyMainEditorChanged()
       └── pagesModel.resubscribeEditor(page)
```

**Demote** (main → secondary-only):
```
1. page.promoteSecondaryToMain(model)  // model IS mainEditor
   ├── this._mainEditor = null         // clear without dispose (model stays as secondary)
   ├── state.mainEditorId = null       // subscribers update the UI: content area becomes empty
   ├── notifyMainEditorChanged()       // secondaries notified with null
   ├── queueMicrotask: restore panels if promoted-from-secondary
   │   ├── If _prePromotePanels saved → restore pre-promote panel list
   │   └── If no saved panels (was originally main, Pattern B) → leave panels as-is
   │       (secondary-view model/view lifecycle manages its own panel list)
   └── pagesModel.resubscribeEditor(page)
```

The demote path does NOT call `setMainEditor(null)` — that would dispose the model. Instead it directly clears the reference, keeping the model alive in `secondaryViews[]`.

**Panel save/restore:** When promoting, the current panel list is saved as `_prePromotePanels`. On demote, if saved panels exist (model was promoted from secondary), they are restored. For Pattern B (model was originally the main editor, no saved panels), panels are left unchanged — the secondary-view model/view lifecycle (e.g., `LinkCategorySecondaryView`) manages the panel list through its model subscription. The `queueMicrotask` lets the demotion complete before the restoration work runs.

---

## 5. Panel Management

**Active panel:** `PageModel.activePanel` tracks which panel is expanded. Only one panel is expanded at a time. Its value is a **composite panel key** `` `${editorId}::${panelId}` `` (see §5a) — e.g. `"a1b2…::archive-tree"`. Use `PageModel.activePanelId` to read the **bare** panel-type id (`"archive-tree"`) for "is panel X expanded" checks.

**Expand:** `page.expandPanel(panelId)` — accepts a **bare** panel-type id (resolved to the owning editor's composite key) or an already-composite key (passed through). Sets activePanel and calls `onPanelExpanded(panelId)` (bare) on the owning model. Used by models to auto-expand their panel (e.g., ArchiveEditorModel expands "archive-tree" when navigating to an archive entry).

**Close — two semantics:**
- **Hide the panel only** (default): the close handler clears `model.secondaryView = undefined`, removing the model from the sidebar (without disposing). The standard pattern for user-closeable panels.
- **Remove the whole Pattern B editor** (`page.removeSecondaryView(model)`): detaches *and disposes* the model. Because `detach()` clears `mainEditorId` when the editor was also the main, this leaves the page empty if the editor was main, and leaves a different main untouched otherwise. Used by `ArchiveSecondaryView` and by `GitTreeEditorModel.requestClose()` (the Git Tree "x"). The Git Tree "x" is intentionally **unconditional** (unlike `ArchiveSecondaryView`, which hides its "x" while it is the main), because the empty-page outcome is the intended behavior.

---

## 5a. Composite Panel Keys

**Source:** [`panel-key.ts`](../../src/renderer/ui/secondary-views/panel-key.ts)

A panel id (`"git-changes"`, `"archive-tree"`) names a panel **type** — the registry key. It is **not** unique within a page: two models can contribute the same type. The canonical case is two open git repositories, each contributing a `"git-changes"` panel. The sidebar must render **all** of them — uniqueness restriction does not belong in the render layer.

A *rendered* panel's identity is therefore the **composite** of its owning editor id and its panel-type id:

```
panelKey(editorId, panelId) → `${editorId}::${panelId}`
```

Editor ids are UUIDs and panel-type ids are kebab-case, so `"::"` is an unambiguous separator. `panel-key.ts` exposes `panelKey()`, `parsePanelKey()` (a bare id with no separator parses to `{ editorId: "", panelId }`), `panelIdOf()`, and `isCompositePanelKey()`.

**Bare vs. composite — the split:**

| Surface | Form | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| `model.secondaryView = [...]` (declaration) | **bare** (`"git-changes"`) | Models declare the panel *type*. They never mint instance ids — uniqueness is the sidebar's job. |
| Registry lookup (`secondaryViewRegistry.get`) | **bare** | One registered component serves every instance of a type. |
| `activePanel` storage + `CollapsiblePanel id` | **composite** | The accordion needs a unique identity per *rendered* panel to track which one is expanded. |
| `expandPanel(id)` | **either** | A bare id resolves to the owning editor's composite; a composite is passed through. |
| `onPanelExpanded(panelId)` + the `panelExpanded` event | **bare** | Editors/subscribers reason about panel *type*, not instances. `setSecondaryViewsState` extracts the bare id from the composite before notifying. |
| `activePanelId` getter | **bare** | Convenience for "is panel X expanded" checks (Explorer/Archive use `this.page?.activePanelId === "explorer"`). |

**Seed/legacy resolution:** the default `activePanel` seed (`"explorer"`) and any legacy persisted bare value are resolved to their composite at render time in `SecondaryViews` (a bare value is matched against the rendered panels' bare ids). When a detached owner or a restore descriptor names a panel that is no longer composed, PageModel selects the first currently composed panel's composite key; if none exists it leaves the active key empty. After any accordion click, `activePanel` is already composite.

**Same-type dedup is a model-level concern, not a render-level one.** Re-clicking the *same* repo's `.git` reuses the existing `GitTreeEditorModel` via `matchesNavigationTarget` (see [pages-architecture.md §9](pages-architecture.md)), so no duplicate model is created. Different repos correctly produce distinct models, and the sidebar renders a `"git-changes"` panel for each. `CollapsiblePanelStack` (UIKit) is untouched — it operates on whatever id string it is given, so feeding it composite keys needs no change.

---

## 6. Rendering in SecondaryViews

**Source:** [`SecondaryViewsView.ts`](../../src/renderer/ui/secondary-views/SecondaryViewsView.ts) and the native secondary-view registry.

The native rendering loop nests: outer loop over models (`flatMap`), inner loop over each model's `secondaryView[]` panel IDs. Every `(model, panelId)` pair is rendered — there is **no** panel-id-uniqueness restriction (the page may render multiple panels of the same type — one per repo). The `CollapsiblePanel` `id` is the **composite** key (§5a); the registry lookup and the `LazySecondaryViewView panelId` prop stay **bare**:

```typescript
this.props.views.flatMap((model) => {
    const panelIds = model.state.get().secondaryView ?? [];
    return panelIds
        .filter((panelId) => secondaryViewRegistry.has(panelId))
        .map((panelId) => ({ model, panelId, key: panelKey(model.id, panelId) }));
});
```

For providers that need the stack-owned header while constructing their content, use the
`childrenFactory(header, isOpen)` form of `CollapsiblePanelStack`. It supplies the actual header
before the child is created and is authoritative when `children` is also present. This keeps the
header and lazy child in one construction path; each secondary view receives the stack-owned header
element as its `headerHost` prop.

Each descriptor is backed by a native `LazySecondaryViewView` and a native
`CollapsiblePanelStackView`. The stack's `childrenFactory(header, isOpen)` receives the
stack-created header before the content is built, so a secondary provider can create/update its
lazy child exactly once with the real header element. This avoids the old render-then-publish-
header handshake. The secondary view's `headerHost` prop is that stack-owned element, and
`childrenFactory` remains authoritative for constructing the panel content.

The stable view key stays `${model.id}-${panelId}`; the accordion identity is the composite `id`. `activePanel` (composite) is passed to `CollapsiblePanelStack` after the bare-seed resolution described in §5a.

**Panel header icon:** each panel header leads with an icon so panels from different editors are distinguishable at a glance. The icon is resolved here — **per-panel registry override first, owning-editor DOM icon otherwise** — by `createIconElement()` or `createEditorIconElement()`. Editor models that own a no-language glyph may expose `getIconElement()`; language editors use the shared file-icon resolver. The resulting `Node` is passed as `SecondaryViewProps.iconElement` to the native panel and then to `SideBarPanelHeaderView`.

**Native headers — `SideBarPanelHeaderView`:** `CollapsiblePanel` owns the header `<div>` and passes it to each secondary view as `headerHost`. Each secondary view creates a [`SideBarPanelHeaderView`](../../src/renderer/ui/secondary-views/SideBarPanelHeaderView.ts), which adopts its caller-owned `Node` values into that host and lays them out as `[icon] [title group] [actions] [show-main zone]`. It accepts `title: string | Node`, a generic `badge?: Node`, and `actions?: Node`; callers own the lifetime of supplied nodes and must provide fresh nodes for each host/use. Appending a node to another host moves it, so do not cache, memoise, hoist, or share one between panels or other consumers:

- the **icon** is rendered first and unwrapped so it stays a direct child of the header `<div>` — the stack's `[data-part="header"] > svg { width: 14; height: 14 }` rule sizes only direct-child SVGs;
- the **title group** (`badge` + `title`) is a flex-grow `Panel` with `width={0}` + `overflow: hidden`, so the title (`<Text truncate size="md">`) and a `truncate` `Tag` badge ellipsize as the sidebar narrows;
- the **actions** region is a `Panel` with `shrink={false}`, so the buttons stay pinned and fully visible — the label group is what gives way, never the buttons;
- the actions region is marked `data-part="header-buttons"`; `CollapsiblePanelStack` excludes that region from its header-toggle handler, so pressing a panel action does not collapse the panel;
- the **show-main zone** is a standardized right-edge button (chevron-right icon, separated by a vertical divider) that appears when the `onShowMain` prop is provided. Clicking it promotes the editor to the page's main view (`stopPropagation` prevents panel toggle). Pass `showMainTitle` to override the tooltip (default: `"Show in main view"`) and `showMainActive={true}` to tint the chevron blue when this editor is already the main view. The zone is always visible — it does not hide when already main; the active tint is the indicator instead.

This replaces per-panel hand-rolled portal + layout. Native children are directly owned by the header host, so no portal or framework-specific header root is needed. The show-main zone (`data-type="sidebar-show-main"`) remains in the `pointer-events: auto` allowlist and guards the header's hover-lighten with `:not(:has([data-type="sidebar-show-main"]:hover))` so the header bar and the zone light up independently.

**`alwaysRenderContent`:** Keeps panel content mounted when collapsed (`display: none`). Required for native providers to keep their header handle and other owned resources synchronized while a panel is collapsed.

**Owner/view contract:** `SecondaryViewsView` receives the owner-supplied `views` list and the
`SecondaryViewsModel` as `nav`. It binds the model's `width` and `activePanel` fields directly, so
layout notifications do not pump a snapshot through the panel tree. The owner supplies two stable
commands and an optional completion callback: `onActivatePanel(panelId)` routes through `setSecondaryViewsState({ activePanel: panelId })`
and preserves panel-expansion side effects; `onResizeWidth(width)` routes through
`setSecondaryViewsState({ width })` and preserves clamping and persistence mirrors; `onResizeEnd(width)`
runs after a moved gesture so the owner can persist the settled value. Owners update
the child only when the ordered `views` model list changes; a fresh array with the same model
identities is not itself a change.

The sidebar container is capped at 90% of its page area, including the half-pane area of a grouped
page. The splitter continues to report live width changes to the page model, while an optional
drag-end signal records the final moved width in the global UI-preference cache; a click without
movement does not record a value. The same splitter completion callback is used by other layout
surfaces that need to persist a settled dimension without handling every pointer move.

**Reactivity:** `secondaryViews` is a plain array (EditorModel instances can't be in TOneState — Immer proxies would corrupt them). PageModel's page-state notifications cause the owner to re-read `panelEditors`; it uses element-wise model identity to update the child only when the ordered list changes. Once mounted, `SecondaryViewsView` binds `width` and `activePanel` directly from `SecondaryViewsModel.state`.

**Registry:** [`secondary-view-registry.ts`](../../src/renderer/ui/secondary-views/secondary-view-registry.ts) maps panel IDs to dynamically-loaded `VanillaViewCtor<SecondaryViewProps>` classes. There is one native registration shape with no runtime renderer discriminator. [`LazySecondaryViewView`](../../src/renderer/ui/secondary-views/LazySecondaryViewView.ts) owns a stable host, cancels stale dynamic imports, and explicitly disposes/removes a panel record when it retires. All built-in secondary providers use this native contract; a board secondary panel uses the native `BoardSecondaryView` and its native `BoardWebview` frame, so its panel host does not add a separate framework root.

Each registration still provides an `id`, `label`, `loadView()` factory, and optional `icon`. Alongside exact-id `register()`, `registerPrefix(prefix, definition)` serves a whole panel-id family; the `board-secondary:` family uses this so one generic `BoardSecondaryView` serves every board-declared secondary view.

---

## 7. Persistence

The sidebar's page-specific `open`, `width`, and `activePanel` state remains in the page cache. A
global learned width is only a seed for a new page's first lazy sidebar model; restoring a page or
moving one between windows does not consult it.

Secondary view state is saved as `SecondaryModelDescriptor[]` in the PageModel sidebar cache (`_saveState()`). Each descriptor contains the model's serialized `IEditorState` from `getRestoreData()`.

On restore:
1. `restoreSidebar()` reads cache, stores descriptors as `pendingSecondaryDescriptors`
2. `restoreSecondaryViews(ownerEditor)` processes them after the mainEditor is created. The `ownerEditor` parameter is nullable — pass `null` for pages without mainEditor (Pattern A standalone secondary views).
3. **Deduplication:** If `ownerEditor` is non-null and a descriptor's ID matches `ownerEditor.id`, the existing ownerEditor instance is reused (added to `secondaryViews[]` directly, no new model created). This handles Pattern B — when mainEditor was also a secondary view before restart.

---

## 8. Dispose

When a tab closes:
1. `page.close()` → `confirmSecondaryRelease()` checks secondary views for unsaved changes
2. `page.close()` → `mainEditor.confirmRelease()` checks main editor
3. `page.dispose()` → iterates `secondaryViews[]`, calls `dispose()` on each, then disposes mainEditor
4. `page.dispose()` → `fs.deleteCacheFiles(this.id)` deletes page-level cache files (e.g., `{pageId}_nav-panel.txt`). Editor-level cache files are deleted by each `EditorModel.dispose()` call.

For Pattern B (mainEditor in secondaryViews[]), the model may be disposed twice by `dispose()`. This is safe — `EditorModel.dispose()` is idempotent (`pipe` is nulled on first call, cache file deletion is a no-op on second call).

---

## 9. PageModel Management API

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `addSecondaryView(model)` | Adds model to array, calls `model.setPage(this)`, bumps version. If model is already registered, still bumps version (panel list may have changed). |
| `removeSecondaryView(model)` | Removes, disposes, falls back `activePanel` if needed |
| `removeSecondaryViewWithoutDispose(model)` | Removes without disposing (used by `secondaryView` setter). Skips `setPage(null)` if model is the mainEditor (Pattern B guard). |
| `promoteSecondaryToMain(model)` | Toggle: if model is secondary-only → promotes to mainEditor (old main goes through `setMainEditor` lifecycle); if model IS mainEditor → demotes (clears mainEditor to null, model stays as secondary). Calls `resubscribeEditor` for persistence. |
| `findSecondaryView(editorId)` | Lookup by editor model ID |
| `confirmSecondaryRelease()` | Iterates modified secondaries, prompts user via `confirmRelease()` |
| `restoreSecondaryViews(ownerEditor)` | Restores from `pendingSecondaryDescriptors`, deduplicates against owner |
| `notifyMainEditorChanged()` | Propagates main editor change, cleans up models that cleared themselves |
| `setActivePanel(panel)` | Sets expanded panel (composite key), notifies owning model via `onPanelExpanded()` (bare id) |
| `expandPanel(panelId)` | Expands a panel. Accepts a **bare** panel-type id (resolved to the owning editor's composite key) or an already-composite key. See §5a. |
| `activePanel` / `activePanelId` | `activePanel` = composite key of the expanded panel; `activePanelId` = its **bare** panel-type id (for "is panel X expanded" checks). See §5a. |
| `findExplorer()` | Returns the ExplorerEditorModel from secondaryViews (if any) |
| `createExplorer(rootPath)` | Creates ExplorerEditorModel, adds to secondaryViews |
| `getTransient<T>(key)` | Read a transient (non-persisted) runtime value by key. Returns undefined if not set. |
| `setTransient(key, value)` | Write a transient runtime value. Pass undefined to delete. Cleared on page close / app restart. |

### Page script surface

`page.panels` is the scripting/AiVision projection of the live sidebar. It reads
`PageModel.panelEditors` in renderer order and each editor's current `secondaryView` list,
filtering ids through the secondary-view registry on every read. Items retain bare panel ids and
report the owning editor instance id (`editorId`), editor kind (`editorKind`), current label, and
expanded state. Composite accordion keys are used only internally by the renderer; the node's
`expand(panelId)` accepts bare ids and resolves duplicates to the first rendered owner, matching
`PageModel.expandPanel`. The limitation is visible through each item's distinct `editorId`.

The node's `isOpen` and `width` values are read-only observations of `SecondaryViewsModel`. They
report `false` and `null` while that model is still lazy and absent. `toggleSidebar()` requires a
current panel, then flips only the model's `open` state; it never calls `toggleNavigator()` and
therefore cannot create an Explorer as a side effect. This node deliberately has no `close` action:
individual panel header controls remain with their owning editors because Pattern A and Pattern B
editors have different hide/dispose lifecycles. The node exposes the four curated sidebar shell
elements (`page-nav-panel`, `secondary-views-container`, `secondary-views-stack`, and
`secondary-views-splitter`) and their `highlight(name, message?)` surface. It also provides
optional live child nodes for the fixed aliases `explorer`, `search`, `boards`, `clipboard`, `git`,
`notebookCategories`, `notebookTags`, `rest`, `archive`, and `fileHistory`. A child exists only
while its registered panel is present on that page; its `id` remains the registered panel ID and
its `ownerEditorId` identifies the contributing editor instance. Specialized Explorer, Search,
Boards, and Git children expose copied state, model-backed actions, and curated panel elements.
The remaining known panel types expose the generic node contract until their specialized projections
are added. Dynamic board-secondary children are indexed by their exact registered IDs. Enumeration
and lookup read existing page state only and never create a sidebar or an absent panel.

## 10. Existing Secondary Editors

| Model | Panel IDs | Pattern | Survival | Created by |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `ExplorerEditorModel` | `["explorer"]`, plus optional `search`, `boards`, and `clipboard` panels | A (separate) | Always survives navigation | `PageModel.createExplorer()` or restore |
| `ArchiveEditorModel` | `["archive-tree"]` | B (mainEditor) | Survives if new editor was opened from this archive | `_openArchive()` in PagesLifecycleModel |
| `LinkEditor` (links) | `["link-category", "link-tags", "link-hostnames"]` (always all 3) | B (mainEditor) | Survives own-link navigation (`sourceId` = editor id / `link-category` / `link-tag` / `link-hostname`) **or while modified** (a dirty collection survives any navigation so unsaved work is never lost); otherwise removed on external navigation. Overrides `beforeNavigateAway` / `onMainEditorChanged`; the same `modified \|\| own-source` predicate drives `survivesNavigation` (skips the save-prompt). | `adoptHost()` sets `secondaryView = LINK_PANELS` |
| `NotebookEditor` | `["notebook-categories", "notebook-tags"?]` | B (mainEditor) | Removed on navigation (default `beforeNavigateAway`). Removed when SecondaryViews closes, re-registered when it opens. "notebook-tags" only when tags exist. | `NotebookEditor.adoptHost()` sets the panel list; PageModel observes the editor state slice |
| `RestClientEditor` | `["rest"]` | B (mainEditor) | Removed on navigation (default `beforeNavigateAway`). Removed when SecondaryViews closes, re-registered when it opens. | `RestClientEditor.adoptHost()` sets the panel list; PageModel observes the editor state slice |
| `LinkEditor` (browser bookmarks) | `["link-category", "link-tags", "link-hostnames"]` | B — hosted on `BrowserPanelHost` (not `PageModel`) | Always present while the browser page is open; sidebar is mandatory-open. | `BrowserPanelHost.attach()` — called by `BrowserEditorModel` during bookmarks init |
| `GitTreeEditorModel` | `["git-changes"]` (label "Git") | B (mainEditor) | **Unconditional survival** — `beforeNavigateAway()` is a no-op, so the panel stays when clicking a changed file or a ref opens its Git Diff (the editor becomes secondary-only). Sole removal path is the panel's manual "x" → `requestClose()` → `page.removeSecondaryView(this)` (tears down the whole editor). Also a per-page navigation-singleton (`matchesNavigationTarget` / `onNavigationReuse`): re-navigating to the same repo reuses this instance instead of stacking duplicates. See [Git Tree panel](#git-tree-panel) below for behavior. | `setPage()` sets `secondaryView = ["git-changes"]` on attach (unconditionally, so a session that persisted an older multi-panel array is migrated) |
| `FileDiffEditor` | `["git-diff-revisions"]` (label "File History") | B (mainEditor) | **Removed on navigation AND editor-switch** — uses the **default** `beforeNavigateAway` (clears `secondaryView`), so the "File History" panel disappears when the page navigates to another file or when the Git Diff is switched back to the Text Editor. The deliberate **opposite** of `GitTreeEditorModel`'s unconditional survival (the panel is meaningful only while its Git Diff is the main editor). | `adoptHost()` sets `secondaryView = ["git-diff-revisions"]` |
| `BoardEditorModel` (+ subclasses) | `["board-secondary:<viewId>", …]` (declared) | Board (see note) | Removed on navigation — base `beforeNavigateAway` clears the derived list; `secondaryViewDefs` is retained so a re-promoted **busy** board re-derives its panels (`onNavigationReuse()`) | Derived from `board-manifest.json` `secondaryViews` and/or `persephone.setSecondaryViews([...])` at runtime |

**Board secondary views** are a distinct mechanism layered on this system: a board declares zero-or-more views, each mapped to a `board-secondary:<viewId>` panel id (an id *family*, not a fixed set). Unlike the built-in editors above — where one registration serves one panel id — the registry resolves the **whole `board-secondary:*` family to one generic component** (`BoardSecondaryView`, prefix-aware `has()`/`get()`), and every panel renders over the **same** board model (so they share `persephone.state.*` and, for content-host boards, the content host). See [editors.md → Board Secondary Views & Shared State](editors.md#board-secondary-views--shared-state) for the full model (frames, `isMain`, shared-state bridge, automation).

### Clipboard panel

The Clipboard panel is an Explorer-owned Pattern A panel. The normal Explorer composition is
Explorer, Search, Boards, then Clipboard as each feature is present. The dedicated Clipboard page
uses the same Explorer host with persisted `hideExplorer`, so its composition contains only the
Clipboard panel. The Tools & Editors registry entry is unconditional and pinnable; opening it
reuses the fixed-ID page rather than creating another tab.

It lists stored history metadata and routes a selected payload through the host page's normal
`openRawLink` pipeline, so `.txt`, `.html`, `.png`, and `.files.txt` payloads use existing editors
rather than a clipboard-specific editor. A file list is one absolute path per line in
`<id>.files.txt`; its `dropEffect` is carried by `ClipboardHistoryItem`, and earlier `.json`
payloads remain readable. The AiVision `clipboard.read(id)` contract returns file items as
`string[]`.

The selected row is persistent navigation state (`selectionStyle: "focus"`) identifying the item
shown by the host page. Rows use the shared file-icon resolver with synthetic `.txt`, `.png`, and
`.html` inputs for text, image, and HTML items; heterogeneous file lists use the resolver's generic
extensionless file icon. The preview is the row label, followed by an outlined local-calendar time
badge (`HH:mm` for today and `-Nd HH:mm` for older dates, with a matching tooltip). The badge and
per-row Copy action share one trailing slot and swap on hover or focus, so the row does not shift.

Arrow Up/Down are handled by a capture-phase listener on the panel: each changed press steps from
the selected row, selects it, and opens it through the same host route as a click. The ListBox active
index follows selection only, so hover does not open a row or leave a stale active highlight. Opens
are serialized in strict FIFO order and ignore queued work after disposal; selection claims list
focus and completed opens restore it. Home/End/Page keys and Enter remain on the ListBox's normal
keyboard path. Copy-back triggers a fresh capture, so the panel follows the copied content to the
new top row. Removal, clearing, and listener-health/restart actions remain owned by the panel view
and the main clipboard service.
When history is disabled, the panel shows the Settings affordance and suppresses Restart while
stored rows and their clear/remove/copy/navigation actions remain available. Closing the panel
clears the Explorer contribution; if this leaves an editorless page with no composed panels,
PageModel closes that sidebar-only page after the dispatch completes.

### Git Tree panel

`GitTreeEditorModel` hosts **one** panel next to the commit graph — `"git-changes"` (label "Git") — composed over focused submodels (`changes`, `branches`, plus `gitTree` for the graph), mirroring how `BrowserEditor` composes submodels. All share the editor's repo root and refresh path. The panel body is split into three segments by an in-body `SegmentedControl` (`Changes` / `Branches` / `Tags`, default `Changes`); the active segment is persisted as `gitPanelTab` in the editor descriptor so it survives navigation + restart.

The panel is assembled from a container plus three header-less segment bodies:
- `GitPanelSecondaryView` — the registered panel: owns the shared `SideBarPanelHeaderView`, the segment `SegmentedControl`, and the segment-switch wiring.
- `GitChangesView` — the `Changes` segment (working-tree status).
- `GitRefsView` — the `Branches` (`show="branches"`) and `Tags` (`show="tags"`) segments.

**Multiple repos coexist.** Opening a second repo's `.git` creates a second `GitTreeEditorModel`, so the page shows one panel per repo (distinct composite keys — see §5a). Each header leads with the repository name (`model.repoName`) rendered as an outlined `Tag` badge — mirroring the Git Tree editor toolbar — to disambiguate.

**Header.** Title is a static `Git (<n>)` where `<n>` is the unique changed-file count — the union of the unstaged + staged repo-relative paths, so a partially-staged file (present in both lists) is counted once; it reads plain `Git` when there are no changes. The count lives in the header (not a segment) so it stays visible while the panel is collapsed, letting the user spot which repos have changes without expanding each one. The header carries **Refresh**, the editor's sole manual **"x"** close (`requestClose()` — tears down the whole editor), and the **"Show Git Tree"** promote-to-main zone (`model.showGitTree()`). The **"AZ"** sort toggle lives in the body toolbar next to the SegmentedControl and shows only for the `Branches` / `Tags` segments.

**Commit-graph row context menu.** Right-clicking a commit row in the graph offers the same "Switch to …" actions as the Branches segment plus **"Create branch here…"** (`createBranchAt` → name prompt → `git switch -c <name> <commit>`, creating + checking out a branch at that commit; invalid/duplicate names toast). Single-commit only — disabled on a multi-row selection.

**Visibility-aware refresh.** A recursive `DirectoryWatcher` on the repo root (debounced 500 ms, started in `syncGitTree()`, disposed in `dispose()`; always-on under `git.enabled`) drives `refresh()` on any repo change — including edits, staging, commits, and checkouts (the watch covers `.git`). `refresh()` reloads only the **currently-visible** surfaces and marks the others stale; a stale surface reloads lazily when next revealed. Visibility is segment-aware: the `changes` submodel counts as visible only when the panel is expanded **and** the `Changes` segment is active; the `branches` submodel (shared by `Branches` and `Tags`) only when one of those segments is active. Switching segments (`setGitPanelTab`) and expanding the panel (`onPanelExpanded`) both reload the now-active segment's submodel if it went stale while hidden. To keep the watch loop-free, the reads (`git status`, `git for-each-ref`) run with `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` (`git-service.ts`) so they never rewrite `.git/index` and re-trigger the watcher.

#### `Branches` / `Tags` segments (`GitRefsView`)

A refs tree built by `git-refs-tree.ts` (`buildRefsTree`) from the `GitRefs` DTO, with three fixed roots: **Branches** (local, with `/`-folder nesting), **Remotes** (one node per remote, branches nested), and **Tags** (flat). `GitRefsView` renders a subset by segment: `show="branches"` shows the Branches + Remotes roots; `show="tags"` shows the tag leaves flat.

- **Active branch** reads head-green (`REF_COLOR.head`) — icon + label — matching the graph's current-branch decoration; no selection background.
- **Ordering** is historical (most-recent-first) by default; the body-toolbar **"AZ" toggle** switches to alphabetical (persisted as `branchesAlphabetical` in the editor descriptor, shared by both ref segments). The git service sorts refs by committer/creator date; `buildRefsTree(refs, alphabetical)` either preserves that order (folders interleave by most-recent member) or sorts by name.
- **Hover** highlight uses the `Tree`'s controlled `activeIndex` / `onActiveChange`.
- **Click-to-reveal:** clicking a ref focuses its commit's "Comment" cell in the graph (`GitTreeModel.revealRef` via the registered `DataGridInstance` handle from `setGrid`); if the ref's tip isn't among the loaded commits, the last row is focused so "Load more / Load all" is in view. Guarded by `isTreeVisible()` (the grid is mounted only when the Git Tree is the page's main editor).
- **Switch context menu** (right-click a leaf): "Switch to Branch" (local; current branch disabled), "Switch to Remote Branch" (creates/reuses a local tracking branch), or "Switch to Tag '<name>' Commit" (detached HEAD at the tagged commit). All call `model.switchTo()`.

#### `Changes` segment (`GitChangesView`)

The working-tree view: unstaged (top) + staged (bottom) `FileGrid`s split by a `Splitter`.

- **Stage / unstage / commit.** A bar above the Staged grid carries a "Commit" button (left) + the stage/unstage arrows (right). Commit opens the modal `showCommitDialog` (`ui/dialogs/CommitDialog.ts`) — an editable **required** branch field (red border when empty, via the UIKit `Input` `invalid` prop) + editable author Name/Email (prepopulated from git config) + message. The author identity is applied as a per-commit `-c` override (no config file is written); the `buttons` array is forward-compatible for a future "Commit and Push".

  The dialog **drives the commit itself** and is git-agnostic: the caller injects an `onAction` callback (which calls `model.changes.commit(message, identity?, newBranch?)`), and the dialog gates closing on it via `TDialogModel.canClose` — staying open on failure (e.g. an invalid or duplicate branch name) for a fix-and-retry, closing only on success, with its action buttons disabled while in flight (`committing`). Keeping the prefilled current branch commits to it; editing the name — or a detached HEAD, whose field starts empty — creates **and checks out** a new branch first (`git switch -c`, which carries the staged index) so the commit lands on it. The dialog compares the edited value against the open-time branch (`originalBranch`) and relabels the action button **"Create Branch & Commit"** in that case (the button's action identity stays `"Commit"`). Requiring a branch even when detached is deliberate — it turns what would be a dangling commit into one kept on a real branch.
- **Stage/unstage/reset** are also available via double-click and a right-click context menu on the file grid (`FileGrid`).
- **Single click opens the file's Git Diff** in the page (`openChangeDiff(change, list)`). The list the click came from picks the preselected comparison: the **Staged** list opens `Last commit (HEAD) ↔ Staged` so a fully-staged file shows real changes; the **Unstaged** list keeps the editor's default `Staged ↔ Unstaged`. The selection rides the link pipeline (`diffFrom`/`diffTo` hints) — no direct editor call.

The File Diff "File History" panel (`["git-diff-revisions"]`) shows the file's filtered commit history with synthetic Unstaged/Staged rows + per-row L/R (from/to) side-select toggles bound to the editor's single `from`/`to` state. The same `from`/`to` can be **preselected when the diff opens** via the `diffFrom`/`diffTo` link hints — e.g. opening a commit's changed file in a new tab as `previous commit ↔ selected commit`. The editor exposes `applyDiffRevisions(from, to)`, consumed once on a fresh build and guarded against the default-resolution pass (`initDiffDefaults`) so an explicit selection is never overwritten.

## 11. Adding a New Secondary Editor

### Step 1: Create the EditorModel subclass (or use an existing mainEditor model)

**For Pattern A** (separate model):
```typescript
class MySecondaryModel extends EditorModel<MyState> {
    // Set secondaryView when ready
    setPage(page: PageModel | null): void {
        super.setPage(page);
        if (page && this.isReady) {
            this.secondaryView = ["my-panel"];
        }
    }
    
    // Decide survival on navigation
    beforeNavigateAway(newEditor: EditorModel): void {
        if (this.shouldSurvive(newEditor)) return; // keep secondaryView set
        this.secondaryView = undefined; // clear → removed from sidebar
    }
    
    // React to main editor changes
    onMainEditorChanged(newMainEditor: EditorModel | null): void {
        if (!newMainEditor || newMainEditor === this) return;
        // Update highlights, or clear secondaryView to remove self
    }
    
    // React to panel expansion
    onPanelExpanded(panelId: string): void {
        if (panelId === "my-panel") {
            // Scroll to highlighted item, refresh content, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

**For Pattern B** (mainEditor as secondary):
```typescript
class MyMainEditorModel extends EditorModel<MyState> {
    setPage(page: PageModel | null): void {
        super.setPage(page);
        if (page && this.isReady) {
            this.secondaryView = ["my-panel"]; // adds self to secondaryViews[]
        }
    }
    
    beforeNavigateAway(newEditor: EditorModel): void {
        if (this.isRelatedTo(newEditor)) return; // survive as secondary
        this.secondaryView = undefined; // don't survive
    }
    
    onMainEditorChanged(newMainEditor: EditorModel | null): void {
        if (!newMainEditor || newMainEditor === this) return; // guard self-notification
        if (!this.isRelatedTo(newMainEditor)) {
            this.secondaryView = undefined; // remove self if unrelated
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Register panel components

In [`register-editors.ts`](../../src/renderer/editors/register-editors.ts):
```typescript
secondaryViewRegistry.register({
    id: "my-panel",
    label: "My Panel",
    loadView: async () => {
        const mod = await import("./my-editor/MySecondaryView");
        return mod.default;
    },
});
```

### Step 3: Create the native panel provider

Create a `VanillaView<SecondaryViewProps>` provider. Build a `SideBarPanelHeaderView` against `headerHost`; pass `iconElement`, a string or DOM `Node` title, an optional caller-owned `badge` node, and native action roots. Keep the panel body and all subscriptions under the view's lifecycle ownership:

```typescript
export default class MySecondaryView extends VanillaView<SecondaryViewProps> {
    private readonly model: MySecondaryModel;
    private readonly header: SideBarPanelHeaderHandle;

    public constructor(props: SecondaryViewProps) {
        super(props, createPanelElement({ name: "my-secondary-view", flex: true }));
        this.model = props.model as MySecondaryModel;
        this.header = createSideBarPanelHeader({
            headerHost: props.headerHost,
            icon: props.iconElement,
            title: "My Panel Title",
        });
    }

    protected onMount(): void {
        this.own(() => this.header.dispose());
        this.root.append(createPanelElement({ name: "my-secondary-content" }));
    }

    protected onUpdate(props: SecondaryViewProps): void {
        this.header.update({ headerHost: props.headerHost, icon: props.iconElement, title: "My Panel Title" });
    }

    protected onDispose(): void {
        this.header.dispose();
    }
}
```

A title-only panel supplies only `headerHost`, `iconElement`, and `title`. Conditional actions are native roots: mount or update the action view only while `expanded !== false`, and pass `actions: undefined` when the panel is collapsed.

`SecondaryViewProps` also carries `expanded` — `true` when this panel is the one currently expanded in the stack, `false` when it is collapsed to a header strip. Panels stay mounted while collapsed (`alwaysRenderContent`), and the native header remains synchronized, so actions that only make sense while the body is visible should be omitted when `expanded === false`. This does not gate the show-main zone: keep `onShowMain` supplied while collapsed so the chevron remains available.

To add a standardized "show main view" button at the right edge, pass `onShowMain` (a callback that calls `page.promoteSecondaryToMain(model)` or an editor-specific equivalent) and optionally `showMainActive` (blue-tints the chevron when the editor is already main) and `showMainTitle` (tooltip override). The zone is always rendered when `onShowMain` is provided — never hidden, even when already main:

```typescript
this.header.update({
    headerHost: props.headerHost,
    icon: props.iconElement,
    title: "My Panel Title",
    onShowMain: this.showMain,
    showMainActive: this.model.page?.mainEditor === this.model,
    showMainTitle: "Show in main view",
});
```

### Step 4: Create or add to `secondaryViews[]`

**For Pattern A** — create the model and add it:
```typescript
const myModel = new MySecondaryModel();
page.addSecondaryView(myModel);
// Or let the model self-register via setPage → this.secondaryView = [...]
```

**For Pattern B** — the mainEditor sets `secondaryView` on itself:
```typescript
// In the mainEditor model (e.g., in setPage or restore)
this.secondaryView = ["my-panel"];
// This automatically adds this model to page.secondaryViews[]
```

## 12. CategoryEditor — Provider-Agnostic Folder Viewer

**Source code:** [`CategoryEditor.ts`](../../src/renderer/editors/category/CategoryEditor.ts), [`CategoryEditorModel.ts`](../../src/renderer/editors/category/CategoryEditorModel.ts)

CategoryEditor is the main content area editor for `tree-category://` links. Its native
`CategoryEditorView` renders CategoryView for any ITreeProvider — file system folders, archive
subfolders, or future link categories.

`CategoryView` owns provider-backed listing, selection, search, drag-and-drop, and file actions. It
does not import the link editor's list/tile components. Instead, `CategoryEditor` supplies an
`itemsView(host, initialProps)` factory that creates the concrete `LinksListView` or
`LinksTilesView` and returns a typed `CategoryItemsViewHandle`. `CategoryViewImpl` claims that
handle as its child, mounts it, updates it from the current projection, and releases it when the
item arm changes or the content disappears; the stable host remains a structural slot owned by the
Category view.

This is the same caller-supplied owned-view pattern as `PopoverView`'s
`contentView(host) => IOwnedView`: the caller selects the concrete view and keeps the import boundary,
while the receiving view owns the returned handle's lifetime. The typed handle gives CategoryView a
direct update path instead of a raw `Node`-returning render callback, so projection changes and the
required grid invalidation happen in one synchronous reconciliation. The factory stays in
`CategoryEditor`, keeping `components/tree-provider/` free of static editor imports.

The Category toolbar uses the same host-oriented vocabulary. `CategoryViewProps.toolbarHost` is a
caller-owned DOM host supplied by `CategoryEditor` and attached through `PageToolbarView`; the
Category view owns and appends its search, clear, and view-mode controls there, and detaches those
controls when the host changes or the view is disposed. It does not dispose or remove the host.
`GitPanelSecondaryView`'s `toolbarHost` field is the existing house precedent for this host-passing
name.

### Provider Resolution

CategoryEditor resolves its ITreeProvider by scanning `page.secondaryViews[]`. It matches the `tree-category://` link's `type` and `url` against each secondary view's `treeProvider.type` and `treeProvider.sourceUrl`:

```
tree-category:// link: { type: "archive", url: "D:\archive.epub", category: "OEBPS" }
                                ↓ scan secondaryViews[]
    ExplorerEditorModel → treeProvider.type="file", sourceUrl="D:\temp"     → no match
    ArchiveEditorModel  → treeProvider.type="archive", sourceUrl="D:\archive.epub" → MATCH
```

This uses a duck-type interface — no EditorModel base class changes:

```typescript
interface ITreeProviderHost {
    treeProvider: ITreeProvider | null;
    selectionState: TOneState<NavigationState>;
}
```

Both `ExplorerEditorModel` and `ArchiveEditorModel` expose `treeProvider` and `selectionState` with identical signatures.

### Navigation Survival

When CategoryEditor navigates (user double-clicks a subfolder), it passes the host's model ID as `sourceId` in the ILinkData. This ensures the secondary view's `_isOpenedFromThisArchive()` check recognizes the navigation and keeps the panel alive.

### PageModel Notification

PageModel notifies the main editor when secondary views change. In `addSecondaryView()`, `removeSecondaryView()`, and `removeSecondaryViewWithoutDispose()`, PageModel checks if the main editor implements `onSecondaryViewsChanged()` and calls it. CategoryEditorModel implements this method to trigger a provider re-scan.

### Restore Timing

Secondary views are restored asynchronously after the main editor. On mount, if no provider is found, CategoryEditor retries after 50ms via `setTimeout`. This handles the case where the page is restored and the secondary view isn't ready yet.

### Breadcrumb Navigation

CategoryEditor renders a `Breadcrumb` (UIKit) on the left of its toolbar showing the path from the provider's root (`provider.displayName` as the root chip) down to the current folder. Clicking the root chip or any intermediate chip navigates the **same page** to that ancestor — it builds a `tree-category://` link via `encodeCategoryLink({ type, url: sourceUrl, category })` and dispatches `openRawLink` with the host's model ID as `sourceId` (the same mechanism as folder double-click, so the secondary panel survives the navigation). The root chip navigates to `provider.rootPath`.

The path segmentation is provider-specific because category-path conventions differ, so it is delegated to the provider via the `ITreeProvider.getCategorySegments(category)` method:

```typescript
interface ITreeProvider {
    /** Ordered breadcrumb segments root → leaf (excludes the root chip).
     *  Each segment's `category` can be fed to encodeCategoryLink({ category }). */
    getCategorySegments(category: string): ICategorySegment[]; // { label, category }
}
```

- **LinkTreeProvider / ArchiveTreeProvider** — `category` is already a `/`-separated **relative** path (`rootPath === ""`). Both delegate to the shared `relativeCategorySegments()` helper in [`tree-provider-link.ts`](../../src/renderer/content/tree-providers/tree-provider-link.ts).
- **FileTreeProvider** — `category` is an **absolute** OS path (`rootPath === sourceUrl`). Its implementation strips the `rootPath` prefix for the segment labels but keeps `/`-joined absolute paths as each segment's navigation `category` (`readdirSync` accepts `/` on Windows).

The UIKit `Breadcrumb` is used with its opt-in `clipStart` prop: on overflow it shrinks within the toolbar row and clips the **start** (root) side, keeping the trailing (current) folder visible. See [`uikit/CLAUDE.md`](../../src/renderer/uikit/CLAUDE.md) for the component contract.

### Selection, Drag-and-Drop and Live Refresh

The folder page is a peer of the Explorer tree, not a read-only preview: where the provider allows
it, the same gestures work in both. `CategoryEditor` gates this with a single call —
`multiSelect={supportsMultiSelect(provider)}` — and `supportsMultiSelect` is currently
`type === "file"`. Archive and Mneme folder pages therefore stay single-select, because the plural
actions are the file-move / file-import pair and a catalog provider would need the `importLinks`
branch the tree has.

What the gate turns on:

- **Selection** — Ctrl/Shift+click, Ctrl+A, `Delete`, `Escape`. Shift is tested *before* Ctrl,
  which is what makes Ctrl+Shift+click a range extend without a third rule. The set lives in
  `CategoryViewModel.state.selectedHrefs` and is transient: it is cleared when the category or
  provider changes and never persisted, because a folder page re-lists from scratch each time it
  opens. `props.selectedHref` remains the singular *primary* item — the one-way channel the
  Explorer tree shares — so the two never fight over one value.
- **Plural context menu** — replaces the single-row menu and skips the `linkContextMenu` layer
  entirely, since Layer-2/3 subscribers are written against one item. Counts shown in the labels
  are the *pruned* counts.
- **Drops** — onto a folder row (into that folder) or onto whitespace, an empty-folder
  placeholder, or a file row (all meaning *the open folder*, because a file's parent **is** the
  open folder). `drop` stops propagation, which is what suppresses the global
  open-dropped-files-as-tabs fallback.
- **Drag-out** — a native OS drag (`api.startOsFileDrag`) carrying N paths, so Windows Explorer
  and Teams accept it. A native drag dropped back inside any Persephone window re-enters as an
  ordinary OS file drop, so one gesture serves external and internal targets alike.

Only *visible* items participate: rows hidden by the search filter are excluded from every plural
action, and the selection is pruned so an item inside a selected folder is never acted on twice.

**Live refresh.** The page subscribes to the provider's optional `watch(callback)` and re-lists on
each tick, so it tracks changes made anywhere else — the Explorer tree beside it, another window,
Windows Explorer, or an agent. `watch` is an opt-in capability rather than part of `ITreeProvider`,
so the check is duck-typed exactly as the tree's is; the file provider implements it with one
recursive `fs.watch` debounced at 500ms. Re-listing never flashes, because the loading placeholder
is gated on an empty listing and the previous items stay on screen; the selection is re-validated
against the new listing, so an externally deleted file drops out instead of being carried into the
next batch action.

The set-shaped actions themselves are shared with the Explorer tree rather than reimplemented —
see [`plural-actions.ts`](../../src/renderer/components/tree-provider/plural-actions.ts) and
[`tree-drop-actions.ts`](../../src/renderer/components/tree-provider/tree-drop-actions.ts). Both
are *target-shaped*: the drop helpers take a `DropTarget` of `{ path, title }`, not a tree node,
which is the whole reason two very different views can call them.

## 13. Tag-Based Navigation Panel

**Source code:** [`LinkTagsSecondaryView.ts`](../../src/renderer/editors/link-editor/panels/LinkTagsSecondaryView.ts), [`LinkTreeProvider.ts`](../../src/renderer/editors/link-editor/LinkTreeProvider.ts)

When a `LinkEditor` (links, standalone) is opened as a secondary view with available tags, the Tags navigation panel (`"link-tags"`) renders two parts:

**Top:** `LinkTagsPanel` — existing tag selector (unchanged from main editor). User selects a tag, which updates shared `LinkEditor.state.selectedTag`.

**Bottom:** `LinksList` grid with links for the selected tag. Clicking a link dispatches `openRawLink` with:
- `sourceId: "link-tag"` — signals that this link came from tag-based navigation
- `selectedTag: string` — the selected tag, stored in `ILinkData.selectedTag`
- Link is opened in the same page (if standalone) or in player if appropriate

### Provider Support

Tag-based navigation requires the secondary view's `ITreeProvider` to expose:

```typescript
interface ITreeProvider {
    readonly hasTags: boolean;
    getTags?(): ITreeTagInfo[];      // All tags with counts
    getTagItems?(tag: string): ILink[]; // Links matching a tag
}
```

`LinkTreeProvider` implements both:
- `getTags()` — aggregates unique tags from all links, with item counts
- `getTagItems(tag)` — returns all (non-directory) links with the specified tag. Empty string `""` returns all non-directory links (the "All" virtual tag).

### Player Track Navigation

When `VideoEditorModel` navigates to a link with `sourceId === "link-tag"`:

1. **Lookup sibling provider:** Scans `page.secondaryViews[]` for a links editor exposing `treeProvider` + `selectByHref()` (duck-typed).
2. **Get sibling tracks:** Calls `treeProvider.getTagItems(sourceLink.selectedTag)` to list all links in the same tag.
3. **Track navigation:** `canPlayNext()`, `findSourceProvider()`, `getSiblingTracks()`, and `navigateToTrack()` all recognize `sourceId === "link-tag"` and use the tag-filtered sibling list instead of a directory listing.
4. **Selection update:** After navigation, `selectByHref()` is called to highlight the new link in the tags panel.

This pattern allows the player to treat tags as navigation containers (like folders), supporting next/previous track within a tag.

### ILinkData Additions

The `sourceId: "link-tag"` pattern uses a new field on `ILinkData`:

```typescript
export interface ILinkData {
    // ... other fields ...
    
    // ── Source tracking ───────────────────────────────────────────
    sourceId?: string;     // "link-tag", "archive-id", etc.
    selectedTag?: string;  // Tag name when opened from tag navigation
                           // Not persisted in sourceLink, re-read from sourceId on restore
}
```

`selectedTag` is **ephemeral** — not persisted to `sourceLink` because the player re-derives it on restore by reading `sourceLink.selectedTag` (which was set when the link was stored).

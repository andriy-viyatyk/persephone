# Content Delivery Pipeline

## Overview

The content delivery pipeline (`/src/renderer/content/`) is a unified I/O layer that decouples editors from data sources. Instead of editors reading files directly, all content flows through composable pipes that combine a data source (provider) with data effects (transformers). This makes it possible to open a file inside a ZIP archive, decrypt it on the fly, and save it back -- all transparent to the editor.

The pipeline replaces scattered file I/O calls across the codebase. It handles encoding detection, file watching, caching, and serialization for session restore.

## 3-Layer Pipeline

Opening content flows through three event-driven layers. Each layer is registered as an `EventChannel` subscriber during bootstrap. Subscribers execute in LIFO order, so later registrations act as higher-priority interceptors.

```

### Layer 1 — Parsers

Registered in `parsers.ts` via `registerRawLinkParsers()`. Each parser receives an `ILinkData` object, reads `data.href`, enriches the object (sets `data.url`, HTTP fields, etc.), and forwards the same object on `app.events.openLink`. Registration order (LIFO):

| Parser | Detects | Example input |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| cURL/fetch | `curl ` or `fetch(` prefix | `curl -H "Auth: x" https://api.com/data.json` |
| tree-category | `tree-category://` prefix | `tree-category://base64...` (folder navigation) |
| Persephone guide | `persephone-guide://` prefix | `persephone-guide://editors/grid#sorting` |
| data: URL | `data:` prefix | `data:text/javascript;base64,Y29uc3Q...` (inline content) |
| HTTP | `http://` or `https://` prefix | `https://example.com/file.json` |
| Archive | `!` separator (via `isArchivePath`) | `C:\docs.zip!data/report.json` |
| File | Everything else (fallback) | `C:\Users\file.txt`, `file:///path` |

**Fragment extraction.** A trailing `#fragment` on an incoming href is an in-document anchor, not part of the path, so the file, archive, `mneme://`, and `persephone-guide://` parsers split it off into the ephemeral `data.fragment` hint (URL-decoded, without the `#`) before resolving. This is done **only for real URLs** (`file://`, `mneme://`, `persephone-guide://`), never for a bare filesystem path: in a URL a literal `#` must be percent-encoded as `%23`, which makes the split unambiguous, whereas `#` is a legal character in Windows file and folder names (`C:\notes\C#\readme.md`). The HTTP parser leaves fragments in the URL, where the browser handles them.

### Layer 2 — Resolvers

Registered in `resolvers.ts` via `registerResolvers()`. Each resolver uses `resolveUrlToPipeDescriptor()` (from `link-utils.ts`) to create a pipe descriptor, then `createPipeFromDescriptor()` (from `registry.ts`) to instantiate the pipe. Enriches the `ILinkData` object (sets `data.pipe`, `data.pipeDescriptor`, `data.target`) and forwards the same object on `app.events.openContent`.

- **File resolver** (fallback) -- resolves file paths and archive paths (with "!") to pipe descriptors. Resolves target editor via `editorRegistry.resolveId()`. Two short-circuits run before pipe resolution: (1) explicit **browser intent** (`data.target === "browser"` or a `browserMode` is set) normalizes the path to a `file://` URL via `toFileUrl()` and opens it in a browser through the shared `openLinkInBrowser()` helper, bypassing Layer 3; (2) a plain (non-virtual, non-archive) path is `stat`-ed via `app.fs.stat()` and, if it is a **directory**, opens an empty page (no main editor) with the Explorer panel rooted at the folder via `pagesModel.addEmptyPageWithNavPanel()` and marks `data.handled`. Directories never produce a content pipe.
- **HTTP resolver** -- resolves HTTP/HTTPS URLs to pipe descriptors. A content-extension set decides whether a URL is content or should open in the browser; once it is content, the normal editor registry resolves the built-in editor and the merged resolver may select an eligible board. URLs without recognized extensions (or explicit browser intent) open in the browser via `openLinkInBrowser()`, short-circuiting Layer 3 the same way. cURL/fetch requests with `Accept` headers use header-based editor resolution.

  The set is intentionally separate from editor matching. `.pdf` remains in it with a browser-fallback override: a qualifying board wins, and without one the browser tab renders it natively. Registered built-in editors and eligible boards otherwise follow the same resolution path as local files.
- **Guide resolver** -- resolves `persephone-guide://<corpus-path>[#fragment]` to a read-only `GuideProvider` pipe targeting the Markdown editor. The corpus path is relative to the application-shipped guide index and omits the `.md` suffix; the fragment is carried as the ephemeral navigation hint. The provider's fragment-free `sourceUrl` is the stable scheme identity used in persisted source links.
- **Drawing-image resolver** -- when `data.target === "draw-view"` and `data.url` is a `data:image/*` URL, imports the image as a **new untitled Excalidraw drawing** via `pagesModel.addDrawPage()` (which embeds it in a fresh scene) and marks `data.handled`, short-circuiting Layer 3. Registered last so it runs first (LIFO), intercepting before the file resolver would build a pipe. Import-only: the drawing is a new page, never bound to (so never overwriting) the image source. Accepts only data URLs -- a caller with an http/file image converts it to a data URL first.

`openLinkInBrowser()` is the single browser-routing path shared by both resolvers, so `target: "browser"` / `browserMode` works identically for local files and remote URLs. It honors `browserPageId` (route to a specific browser page), `browserMode` (`os-default` → `shell.openExternal`; `internal` / `profile:<name>` / `incognito` → `pagesModel.lifecycle.openUrlInBrowserTab()`), and otherwise the `link-open-behavior` setting.

The `resolveUrlToPipeDescriptor()` utility is also used by tree providers to create pipes from URLs without going through the event channel system.

### Layer 3 — Open Handler

Registered in `open-handler.ts` via `registerOpenHandler()`. Reconstructs the full file path from the pipe (combining provider `sourceUrl` + ArchiveTransformer `entryPath` for archive files). Cleans the `ILinkData` via `cleanForStorage()` (removes pipeline-only and one-shot navigation fields) and stores the resulting `StoredLinkData` as `IEditorState.sourceLink`. Then either:
- Opens a new page via `pagesModel.lifecycle.openFile(filePath, pipe, { sourceLink })` -- the page owns the pipe.
- Navigates an existing page via `pagesModel.lifecycle.navigatePageTo()` (when `data.pageId` is set) -- disposes the pipe since navigation creates its own.

Both paths forward the ephemeral **navigation hints** to the editor: `revealLine`/`highlightText` scroll/highlight a text editor, `diffFrom`/`diffTo` (each an `ILinkDiffRevision` — `unstaged` / `staged` / `head` / `commit`, where a `commit` with an empty hash denotes the empty tree) preselect the two sides of a File Diff comparison, and `fragment` scrolls to an in-document anchor.

Most hints are consumed only on a **fresh editor build**, never on a reuse/activate path, so they cannot perturb an already-open page. `fragment` is the deliberate exception: an anchor link into a document that happens to be open already is still a jump request, so it is applied on every exit of both open paths — including the editor-reuse early returns and `openFile`'s existing-page dedupe — through the optional `EditorModel.revealFragment?(fragment)` hook (same opt-in shape as `onNavigationReuse?()`; editors without in-document anchors simply don't implement it). A fragment also does **not** join `revealLine`/`highlightText` in forcing the Monaco text editor: those hints address lines and therefore need Monaco, whereas an anchor must keep the language preview editor (e.g. the Markdown view) that renders the headings it points at.

The `sourceLink` (`StoredLinkData`, the persistence-safe subset of `ILinkData`) is stored in `IEditorState.sourceLink` and persisted across app restarts. It records the page's origin (URL, target editor, title, ILink metadata, HTTP fields, etc.) but is informational only — it does not affect page content or I/O.

## Content Pipe

The content pipe implementation uses lazy original reads for write transforms and a paired source/cache owner for text pages.

`IContentPipe` is the central abstraction. It composes one `IProvider` with zero or more `ITransformer` instances.

### Read flow

```
provider.readBinary() → transformer[0].read() → transformer[1].read() → ... → result
```

`readText()` adds encoding detection after the binary chain: `readBinary() → decodeBuffer()`.

### Write flow

```
result → ... → transformer[1].write(data, readOriginal) → transformer[0].write(data, readOriginal) → provider.writeBinary()
```

Transformers are walked in reverse order. Each receives the new data and a lazy `readOriginal()` callback for the original data at that stage. `ArchiveTransformer` invokes it to rebuild the archive around the modified entry; transforms that do not need the original avoid reading the provider. The callback memoizes each stage and returns an empty buffer when the provider has no existing content.

`writeText()` encodes the string first: `encodeString() → writeBinary()`.

### Conditional capabilities

- `writable` -- true only if the provider is writable AND all transformers implement `write`.
- `watch` -- delegates to `provider.watch()` if supported. Returns a `() => void` disposer.

## Built-in Providers

| Provider | Type | Writable | Watch | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `FileProvider` | `file` | Yes | Yes | Local file read/write via `fs`. Debounced watch (300ms). |
| `HttpProvider` | `http` | No | No | HTTP/HTTPS fetch via `nodeFetch`. Supports method, headers, body. Re-fetches on each read (no internal caching). |
| `CacheFileProvider` | `cache` | Yes | No | Cache directory file (`{userData}/cache/{pageId}.txt`). Used as provider for cache pipes. |
| `GuideProvider` | `guide` | No | No | Read-only access to application-shipped Markdown guides through `persephone-guide://`; strips front matter and returns UTF-8 body bytes. |

All providers implement `toDescriptor()` for serialization and `sourceUrl` for display/identity. `GuideProvider` is the intentional encoding exception: its packaged corpus has a known UTF-8 encoding, so it decodes the source to remove front matter before returning body bytes.

## Built-in Transformers

| Transformer | Type | Persistent | Description |
|-------------|------|------------|-------------|
| `ZipTransformer` | `zip` | Yes | Extract/replace a single entry in a ZIP archive via jszip (dynamic import). Write rebuilds the archive with the modified entry. |
| `DecryptTransformer` | `decrypt` | No | AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt via `shell.encryption`. Non-persistent -- password must never be serialized to disk. |

The `persistent` flag controls whether the transformer appears in `toDescriptor()` output. Non-persistent transformers are excluded from serialization but still participate in `clone()` (in-memory only).

## Dual-Pipe Model

`TextFileIOModel` maintains two pipes for each text page:

```
Primary pipe:  FileProvider("report.json") → [ZipTransformer, DecryptTransformer]
               ↕ read/write source file

Cache pipe:    CacheFileProvider(pageId) → [ZipTransformer, DecryptTransformer]
               ↕ auto-save unsaved changes
```

The `PipePair` owner creates the cache via `primaryPipe.cloneWithProvider(new CacheFileProvider(id))`. This ensures the cache pipe shares the same transformer chain -- encrypted files stay encrypted in cache, archive entries stay in ZIP format. It replaces the primary and cache atomically and owns disposal of both.

When the primary pipe changes (e.g., after decryption adds a `DecryptTransformer`), `PipePair.setPrimary()` rebuilds the cache pipe before releasing the old pair. `TextFileIOModel` owns watcher setup around that operation.

## Encoding Detection

`decodeBuffer()` in `encoding.ts` detects text encoding with this priority:

1. **BOM detection** (O(1)) -- UTF-8-BOM (`EF BB BF`), UTF-16LE (`FF FE`), UTF-16BE (`FE FF`)
2. **Large file skip** -- files >20MB default to UTF-8 (skip detection)
3. **Explicit override** -- if encoding was previously detected and passed in
4. **jschardet** -- statistical detection with >70% confidence threshold
5. **UTF-8 probe** -- decode as UTF-8 and check for replacement characters (`U+FFFD`)
6. **Fallback** -- Windows-1251

The detected encoding is stored on the pipe (`pipe.encoding`) and persisted in `IPipeDescriptor` so that write-back uses the same encoding. `encodeString()` handles the reverse, including BOM insertion for UTF-8-BOM and UTF-16 variants.

## Clone-and-Try Pattern

Pipes are immutable-by-convention. When a transformation needs to be tested before committing (e.g., decryption with a user-provided password), use the clone-and-try pattern:

1. `clone()` the active pipe (deep copies provider and all transformers via descriptors)
2. `addTransformer()` or `removeTransformer()` on the clone
3. Attempt `readText()` on the clone
4. **Success** -- pass the clone to `TextFileIOModel.setPrimary()`; `PipePair` swaps the pair and disposes the old pipes
5. **Failure** -- dispose the clone, keep the original pipe unchanged

Example from `TextFileEncryptionModel.decript()`:

```typescript
const candidate = pipe.clone();
candidate.addTransformer(new DecryptTransformer(password));
try {
    const plaintext = await candidate.readText();
    this.model.io.setPrimary(candidate); // swap source and matching cache
} catch {
    candidate.dispose();               // discard on failure
}
```

The same pattern is used for locking (removing `DecryptTransformer`) and removing encryption entirely.

## Pipe Serialization

Pipes serialize to `IPipeDescriptor` for session persistence (stored in `IEditorState.pipe`):

```typescript
interface IPipeDescriptor {
    provider: IProviderDescriptor;       // { type, config }
    transformers: ITransformerDescriptor[]; // [{ type, config }, ...]
    encoding?: string;                   // detected encoding
}
```

Key rules:
- Only transformers with `persistent === true` are included. `DecryptTransformer` (password) is excluded.
- `createPipeFromDescriptor()` in `registry.ts` reconstructs a pipe from its descriptor using registered factories.
- Provider and transformer types are registered at module load time in `registry.ts` (e.g., `registerProvider("file", ...)`, `registerTransformer("zip", ...)`).

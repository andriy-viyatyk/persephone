# Architecture Overview

> Read this document before creating new modules or making architectural changes.

## Application Type

persephone is an **Electron desktop application** — a Windows Notepad replacement designed for developers. It combines:
- Monaco Editor (VS Code engine) for text editing
- Custom editors for specific file types (Grid, Markdown, Notebook, etc.)
- JavaScript/TypeScript execution environment for data transformation
- Built-in browser with multi-tab support

### Key Characteristics

- **nodeIntegration: true** — Renderer has full Node.js access
- **contextIsolation: false** — Direct Node.js in renderer
- Scripts can `require()` any Node.js module or npm package
- Multi-window support — each window has its own `app` instance

## Object Model

The **Object Model** is the central architectural concept. It provides a single, typed API (`app.*`) that all consumers use — native views, the bounded Excalidraw React island, user scripts, and coding agents all access the same interfaces.

```
  Consumers:    Native UI + draw island │ User Scripts │ Coding Agents
                 │               │                │
  Access:    direct import  │  app/page globals  │  .d.ts types
                 │               │                │
  Object Model:  app.settings, app.fs, app.pages, app.window, app.ui, ...
                 │
  Implementation:  /src/renderer/api/  (one module per interface)
```

### Key interfaces

| Interface | Access | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `app.settings` | `ISettings` | Theme, user preferences |
| `app.editors` | `IEditorRegistry` | Available editors, resolution |
| `app.recent` | `IRecentFiles` | Recently opened files |
| `app.fs` | `IFileSystem` | File I/O, dialogs, paths |
| `app.window` | `IWindow` | Window state, Menu Bar, zoom, multi-window, and the `screen` automation host |
| `app.shell` | `IShell` | OS integration, screen snip, encryption, version |
| `app.ui` | `IUserInterface` | Dialogs, notifications, element highlights |
| `app.downloads` | `IDownloads` | Download tracking |
| `app.menuFolders` | `IMenuFolders` | Sidebar folder shortcuts |
| `app.pages` | `PagesModel` | Page/tab collection, lifecycle |
| `app.proc` | `IProc` | Spawn external processes + stream output (scripts, boards) |

Type definitions live in `/src/renderer/api/types/*.d.ts` and serve triple duty:
1. TypeScript compilation contracts
2. Monaco IntelliSense for user scripts (auto-copied to `assets/editor-types/`)
3. Documentation via JSDoc comments

The `ai-vision` npm package describes this live object model for path-based
callers without creating a second hierarchy. Renderer wrappers and editor facades expose descriptors
next to the objects they describe; the shared resolver walks those descriptors, including dynamic
page/editor children, restricted nodes, assignments, and bounded result shaping. The MCP `call`
tool routes the process-owned `windows` and `main` roots in main, then forwards renderer paths to a
selected window. `AppWrapper.call()` and the Board `persephone.call()` bridge are renderer-rooted
surfaces: they resolve the page/app tree only and do not execute the MCP main-process routing, so
`main.*` is not available through either programmatic surface.

An AiVision descriptor may own a `provide(name)` seam for members that are computed from renderer
state rather than stored on the described object. The renderer uses that seam for curated
`elements` declarations and `highlight(name, message?)`: declarations are indexed for discovery,
visibility is measured live from the DOM, and highlighting calls the existing overlay after
resolving the declared selector.

## Bootstrap Sequence

Each renderer window bootstraps via `src/renderer.ts`:

```
1. app.init()          ──  Fetch version from main process
2. app.initSetup()     ──  Configure Monaco (themes, languages, types)
3. import(index)       ──  Load main bundle, register editors
4. app.initServices()  ──  Load all Object Model interfaces (settings, fs, ui, ...)
5. app.initPages()     ──  Restore persisted pages, handle CLI args
6. app.initEvents()    ──  Subscribe to global/keyboard/IPC events, init MCP handler
7. api.windowReady()   ──  Signal main process → window shown
8. `mount(container)`  ──  Native shell mounts; the draw editor owns its vendor island when opened
```

Steps 1-3 run in parallel. Steps 4-7 are sequential (each depends on the previous).

## Renderer Architecture

The renderer has a framework-free application shell. `src/renderer.ts` performs the asynchronous
bootstrap and calls the `mount(container)` export from `src/renderer/index.ts`. The shell,
coupled components, editor bodies, and Storybook are `VanillaView` classes. React is confined to
the Excalidraw vendor island in `editors/draw/ExcalidrawIsland.tsx`; its root adapter lives beside
that editor in `editors/draw/react-island.ts`. The `react` and `react-dom` runtime entries in
`package.json` are retained solely for this island: `ExcalidrawIsland.tsx` uses React and the
adjacent adapter uses `react-dom/client` to mount it. Global styles are installed by the native
`theme/global-styles.ts` module, so startup creates no React root.

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility | Key files |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **api/** | Object Model interfaces + implementations | `app.ts`, `settings.ts`, `fs.ts`, `pages/`, `internal/`, `types/` |
| **ui/** | Application shell, tabs, sidebar, dialogs; native views with compatibility faces where required | `MainPageView.ts`, `PagesView.ts`, `PageTabsView.ts` + `PageTabView.ts`, `MenuBarView.ts`, `DialogsView.ts` |
| **editors/** | File type handling, content editing | `registry.ts`, `text/`, `grid/`, `browser/`, etc. |
| **content/** | Content I/O pipeline — providers, transformers, pipes | `ContentPipe.ts`, `parsers.ts`, `resolvers.ts`, `providers/`, `transformers/` |
| **scripting/** | Script sandbox, API wrappers, facades | `ScriptRunner.ts`, `ScriptContext.ts`, `api-wrapper/` |
| **automation/** | Shared browser-like operations, CDP, input, and host-scoped refs for Object Model call paths | `operations.ts`, `commands.ts`, `input.ts`, `ref.ts`, `snapshot.ts` |
| **uikit/** | Standalone reusable framework-free component library built from `VanillaView` classes and native DOM builders | `Button/`, `Menu/`, `Tree/`, `ListBox/`, `Select/`, `DataGrid/` (the av-grid boundary), … — see `uikit/index.ts` and `uikit/CLAUDE.md` |
| **components/** | Persephone-coupled components and native views only (KEEP-only) | `icons/`, `page-manager/`, `file-search/`, `tree-provider/`, `file-list/`, `file-grid/`, `git-tree/` |
| **core/** | State primitives, utilities | `state/` (TOneState, TModel), `utils/` |
| **theme/** | Design tokens, themes, static global geometry | `color.ts`, `root.css`, `themes/` |

### Dependency Rules

1. **`core/`** is the foundation — no imports from other renderer layers
2. **`uikit/`** is the standalone library — imports only `core/` and `theme/`. No imports from `api/`, `ui/`, `editors/`, or app-specific code (the contract that lets `uikit/` be split into a separate package later)
3. **`components/`** is persephone-coupled by definition — each remaining folder (`icons/`, `page-manager/`, `file-search/`, `tree-provider/`, `file-list/`, `file-grid/`, `git-tree/`) uses `api/`, the page model, file system, or scripting. New pure primitives do NOT go here — they go in `uikit/`. Icon resolution is split between the builder-backed `theme/icons.ts`, the language resolver, and the DOM-first `components/icons/icon-elements.ts`; the latter stays decoupled from editors by duck-typing (see [editors.md](./editors.md#editor-icons))
4. **`api/`** implements the Object Model — imports `core/`, uses IPC
5. **`content/`** implements the I/O pipeline — imports `core/`, `api/types/`
6. **`editors/`** implement page types — import `core/`, `uikit/`, `components/`, `api/`, `content/`
7. **`scripting/`** wraps `api/`, `editors/`, and `content/` for safe script access
8. **`automation/`** implements the browser-like operations used by Object Model call paths — imports `api/`, `editors/`, `ipc/`; loaded by the renderer's automation facades
9. **`ui/`** orchestrates everything — imports all layers
10. Lower layers must NOT import from higher layers

## Key Subsystems

### 1. State Management

See [state-management.md](./state-management.md).

- Custom reactive primitives in `core/state/` (TOneState, TModel, TComponentModel)
- Object Model interfaces in `api/` use these primitives internally
- `EditorModel<TState>` base class for all editors

### 2. Editor System

See [editors.md](./editors.md).

- All editors in `/editors/` — every editor is an `EditorModel` subclass (32 editor IDs as of current catalog)
- Text-bearing editors compose an `IContentHost` (`TextFileModel` for file-backed, `NoteItemEditModel` for notebook notes) and expose `CONTENT_HOST_TRAIT` for owner-orchestrated switching
- Dynamic loading via `import()` for code splitting
- Scripting facades expose the current editor API through `page.editor`; `page.editorSwitches` mirrors
  the page toolbar's editor choices and performs verified editor switches

### 3. Scripting System

See [scripting.md](./scripting.md).

- JavaScript/TypeScript execution with `page`, `app`, `io`, and `ai` globals
- TypeScript transpilation via sucrase (lazy-loaded, type stripping only)
- Full Node.js access for scripts; renderer UI frameworks are not part of the script context
- API wrappers (AppWrapper, PageWrapper) provide safe, typed access
- Editor facades (28 operation facades plus GenericEditorFacade) for typed current-editor operations;
  narrow the union by `page.editor.id`
- Auto-cleanup of event subscriptions on script completion
- Monaco IntelliSense via `.d.ts` files

### 4. MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol)

- External AI agents (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) control persephone via a Streamable HTTP MCP server
- Protocol: MCP over HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/mcp` (default port 7865)
- Main process: `mcp-http-server.ts` accepts connections using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`; the client instructions, 12 guide resources, and the single advertised tool live under `main/mcp/` as data plus one generic registrar.
- Renderer process: the thin MCP IPC shell delegates through `api/mcp/command-registry.ts` to the `call` handler; the generic transport also serves the internal `board_call` bridge.
- The manifest advertises exactly one tool, `call`. Agent Tools are reached through the root-only
  `tools` node like every other capability: `tools.search` discovers tools, `tools.execute` runs
  them, and `tools.unregisterToolset` revokes a registered root without deleting its folder. There
  is no manifest-trimming flag, because there is nothing left to trim.
- The `call` MCP tool is routed in main: `main` and `windows[i]` are resolved against main-process descriptors, while the remainder is forwarded to the selected renderer and resolved against its AiVision root. Main-process script evaluation is a separately settings-gated branch (`Settings → MCP Server → Allow main-process scripts`); `AppWrapper.call()` does not provide that branch.
- MCP `call` result shaping is general-purpose: when any resolved member returns `{ type: "image", data, mimeType }` or `{ image: { data, mimeType }, ...metadata }`, the main-process adapter emits metadata as text plus a native MCP image content block. The capability is not specific to browser screenshots.
- Renderer `call` results can carry a leading attention block for open renderer dialogs and popup menus. If the action itself opens a blocking renderer dialog, the call returns a pending result while the action continues; a subsequent `call` can inspect `dialogs[i]` and use its adapter's `click(button)` or `cancel()` path. Popup menus are exposed as `menus[0]` with read-only item snapshots and `click(label)` / `close()` actions.
- The renderer AiVision root also exposes curated `ui.elements` declarations with live visibility and resolved selectors, plus `ui.highlight(name, message?)`, which delegates to the app highlight overlay and resolves once the overlay is drawn. The element list is intentionally curated rather than an exhaustive DOM inventory.
- Native file, folder, and message-box dialogs are tracked per application window in main. An ordinary renderer result may carry non-actionable native attention while an asynchronous native dialog remains open; the native-dialog tracker never exposes a driver, and synchronous native dialogs cannot be reported while they block main's event loop. A bridge timeout is converted to `pending` only when the tracker still reports an active native dialog.
- Page and editor reads use the `call` object model: `pages[i].content` returns text, while `pages[i].editor.*` exposes structured editor and image operations. Non-text pages report the relevant editor facade or resource path.
- Multi-window support: `call` accepts optional `windowIndex` and can address `windows[i]`; `windows[i].open()` reopens a closed window with its persisted pages.
- Browser profile support: browser pages report `profileName` / `isIncognito` / `isTor` / active-tab `url`; `settings.browserProfiles` and `settings.defaultBrowserProfile` provide profile discovery, and `pages[i].editor.*` provides deterministic automation.
- App-window automation: `window.screen.*` drives Persephone's own UI, including the tab strip, sidebar, dialogs, and active editor; `windows[i].window.screen` selects another window.
- Log View integration: `pages.logView.push()` is the non-blocking MCP output path over the managed `mcp-ui-log` page; it returns dialog IDs for later `dialogResult()` reads, while script `ui` output shares the same page.
- MCP resources: all 12 focused guides under `assets/guides/agents/` and `assets/guides/formats/` are exposed at `persephone://guides/*`, along with `persephone://guides/full`. Resources are documents; operational discovery comes from `call` hints and `$help`.
- The shipped guide corpus lives under `assets/guides/` and is indexed by the shared code in `src/shared/guides/`, used by both the main-process `guides` node and the About guide browser. Pages carry `title`, `audience`, and `summary` metadata, with optional `screen` and single- or list-valued `editorId` mappings. `guides.<path>.layout` extracts a page's `## Layout` section for screen-oriented guidance; pages without that section return the explicit no-schema result.
- MCP validation: `api/mcp/ui-push-validation.ts` validates Log View dialog entries and output content for the shared `pages.logView.push` path.
- Opt-in via `mcp.enabled` setting — server starts/stops dynamically based on setting changes
- Port is configurable via `mcp.port` setting (default `7865`)
- Script execution uses `ScriptRunner.runWithCapture()` for headless operation with console capture
- Status broadcasting: main process pushes `eMcpStatusChanged` events to all windows on server start/stop and session connect/disconnect — renderer `Window` class holds reactive `mcpRunning`/`mcpClientCount` state, UI shows a title-bar indicator
- Session lifecycle: each client gets one Streamable HTTP session (`McpServer` + transport) kept in a `sessions` map. A session is evicted on explicit `DELETE`, on an idle-timeout reaper (closes sessions with no traffic for 30 min; swept every 60 s — each request bumps a per-session `lastActivity`), or on a `MAX_SESSIONS` cap (evicts least-recently-active on `initialize`). All eviction paths funnel through `transport.close()` → `onclose` → map delete. Sessions deliberately outlive a dropped SSE stream so reconnecting clients keep working; without the reaper, clients that quit without sending `DELETE` would leak sessions indefinitely.

### 5. Content Delivery Pipeline

Unified content I/O layer in `/src/renderer/content/` that decouples editors from data sources.

**Architecture:**
- **IProvider** — data backend (FileProvider, CacheFileProvider, HttpProvider). Reads/writes raw bytes.
- **ITransformer** — data effect applied in chain (ArchiveTransformer, DecryptTransformer). Bidirectional read/write.
- **IContentPipe** — composes a provider with transformers. Handles encoding detection (`readText()`/`writeText()`).
- **IPipeDescriptor** — serializable pipe state for persistence across app restarts.

**3-layer open flow** (all layers pass a single `ILinkData` object):
1. **Parsers** (`parsers.ts`): parse raw href, enrich ILinkData (`openRawLink` → `openLink`)
2. **Resolvers** (`resolvers.ts`): build pipe + resolve target editor (`openLink` → `openContent`)
3. **Open Handler** (`open-handler.ts`): consume pipe, create page

**Dual pipe pattern:** TextFileIOModel maintains two pipes — primary (source file/URL) and cache (auto-save) — through `PipePair`. Both share the same transformer chain, ensuring cached content has the same format as the source (e.g., encrypted files stay encrypted in cache); replacing the primary atomically refreshes and disposes the pair.

**Script access:** The `io` global namespace exposes providers, transformers, `createPipe()`, `createLinkData()`, and `linkToLinkData()` to scripts.

### 6. Trait System

See [trait-system.md](./trait-system.md).

- Universal mechanism for drag-and-drop type negotiation — replaces React-DnD and ad-hoc string checks
- Core primitives in `core/traits/`: `TraitKey<T>`, `TraitSet`, `Traited<V>`, `traited()`, `isTraited()`
- `TraitRegistry` maps serializable `TraitTypeId` strings to `TraitSet` objects (bridges DnD serialization boundary)
- All drag-and-drop is native HTML5; `setTraitDragData`/`getTraitDragData`/`hasTraitDragData`/`resolveTraits` utilities in `core/traits/dnd.ts`
- Only `ILink` has a registered TraitSet; other `TraitTypeId` values are type discriminators for within-component reorder

### 7. Theming System

- CSS Custom Properties — `color.ts` returns `var()` references, and theme definitions set actual values on `:root`
- Theme-independent design tokens are emitted as `--space-*`, `--gap-*`, `--radius-*`, `--size-*`, and `--font-*` variables on `:root`; numeric exports remain available for JavaScript calculations
- Theme definitions in `src/renderer/theme/themes/` (one file per theme, 9 themes)
- `themeState` in `src/renderer/theme/theme-state.ts` is the shared `{ id, isDark }` snapshot: React consumers use the hook, while Monaco, canvas, webview, and other non-React consumers use `get()` and `subscribe()`
- `resolveColor()` in `src/renderer/theme/themes/index.ts` is the single JavaScript path for resolving a theme color to a concrete value; CSS continues to use `var(--color-...)`
- Startup: synchronous `fs.readFileSync` + inline `<script>` in `index.html` for flash-free startup

### 8. Mneme Knowledge-Base Service

**Mneme** is a standalone, single-binary **Rust** service (`mneme/`, alongside `launcher/` and `snip-tool/`) that indexes a tree of markdown documents for full-text and semantic search and exposes a **single MCP interface**. The files on disk are the source of truth; the SQLite index is a derived, rebuildable artifact.

- **Separate process, not in the Electron bundle.** Built in CI via `cargo build --release` and shipped beside `persephone.exe`; not wired into `npm start` / `npm run dist`. Persephone manages it as a Tor-style sidecar — an optional feature (off by default) that the renderer auto-launches and stops based on a settings toggle. Both it and the Tor daemon share one lifecycle implementation, `src/main/sidecar-process.ts` (spawn → stdout-readiness sentinel → stop, with start dedupe and a stale-child guard); their services keep only domain concerns.
- **One transport — Streamable HTTP on loopback** (`127.0.0.1/mcp`, no auth locally). The same server serves Persephone *and* external agents (e.g. Claude Code) concurrently. Persephone consumes it through a single shared MCP client (`mnemeConnection`, wrapping one auto-reconnecting `McpConnectionManager`) that refcounts resource subscriptions and multiplexes change notifications out to per-document watchers.
- **Tool surface** (bare, file-like names): `read`/`write`/`upload`/`edit`/`delete`/`mkdir`/`rename`/`glob`/`grep` (addresses are `{root}/{path}`; the whole root is visible like a filesystem — `include`/`ignore` only scope indexing/search), `search` (`text` FTS5 / `vector` sqlite-vec KNN / `hybrid` RRF default, model on DirectML→CPU via `ort`), views `tree`/`timeline`/`tags`, and management `add_root`/`remove_root`/`list_roots`/`reindex`/`status`/`model_update`/`root_config`/… Resources: documents/attachments at `mneme://{root}/{path}`, the agent guide at `mneme://guide`, and a status snapshot at `mneme://status`; resource subscriptions (`subscribe` + `listChanged`) drive Persephone's live refresh.
- **Index is versioned & rebuildable** — `.mneme/<model>-<precision>/index-v<schemaVer>.db` per root; a model/precision or schema-version change selects a fresh DB (full rebuild from files), no migration code.
- **Persephone-side integration (renderer).** Content flows through the standard delivery pipeline: `MnemeProvider` reads/writes/edits a document over the shared connection (with live-refresh), and `MnemeTreeProvider` browses a root like a filesystem. They back two link schemes — `mneme://{root}/{path}` for documents/attachments and `mneme-folder://` for a root. The UI surface is a config & monitoring editor (roots, include/ignore, reindex progress, model update, log), a root **search** editor with an Explorer-like sidebar tree (create/rename/delete, drag-drop import), and a provider indicator in the editor chrome. Relative `mneme://` image links open in the Image viewer.
- **Crate detail lives in the crate.** This section is only an architectural pointer; the crate's own [`mneme/README.md`](../../mneme/README.md) (module layout, MCP surface, build/test, invariants) is the primary reference. Mneme is kept self-contained / extraction-ready, so it follows its own Rust conventions, not the renderer coding standards.

### 9. Board Subsystem

A **Board** is a small local web application (plain HTML + JS) owned by the user, hosted in an in-DOM cross-origin `<iframe>`. A board is any folder carrying a `board-manifest.json` identity file — it can live anywhere on disk. The Create-board dialog defaults the target to the current Explorer root (when one is open); a board can be created at any path.

**Security model:**
- The board loads in a plain `<iframe src="board://<host>/index.html">` rendered in the host renderer's DOM — no `sandbox` attribute (a bare `sandbox` forces an opaque origin with no stable per-board storage). Each board gets a **distinct cross-origin** `board://<host>` origin, where `host` is a stable hash of the normalized board root minted by `registerBoard` in the main process. Isolation from the Node-privileged host comes from the Same-Origin Policy (a cross-origin child cannot reach `window.parent`), `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames: false`, and the served CSP — adequate for trusted, user-authorized local code. Because the iframe lives in the DOM, all host overlays (page-tab context menu, dropdowns, dialogs, command palette, tooltips) compose over it naturally. This mirrors VS Code's editor-webview model.
- The `board://` protocol is registered **once** on the shared host session and routes by **host → board root** (a `Map` registry, populated on board open, dropped on close). It serves the board's local files; the CSP (`connect-src 'self'`) blocks all remote network access — CDNs, fetch, XHR to external hosts are all forbidden. Distinct `board://<host>` origins give per-board `localStorage`/IndexedDB/cookie isolation without separate session partitions. Per-board origin isolation replaces process-level isolation; the trade-off is accepted because a board is the user's own trusted code (it can already run arbitrary processes via `execute()`).
- Trust is **per board**: only boards the user has explicitly trusted render. The decision is persisted by `board-trust.ts` (a path-keyed registry, `trustedBoards.txt` under `<userData>/persephone/data/`) and never read from the manifest or any in-board file — a received board cannot self-trust. Foreign boards prompt a "Trust board" dialog on first open; boards created through Persephone's own API (`app.boards.createBoard`/`createDemoBoard`, user or agent) are auto-trusted at creation. Trust is inherited down the tree — a board nested inside a trusted folder is trusted automatically, and the registry never holds an ancestor/descendant pair (outer wins). This trusted-boards list also *is* the known-boards registry surfaced in the sidebar.

**Bridge (`window.persephone`):**
- `persephone.call(path, options?)` is a page-scoped bridge operation over the board's MessagePort. The renderer resolves the AiVision tree using the Board's hosting page (not whichever tab is active), returns JSON-safe shaped values with hints disabled, and rechecks Board trust for every call. It exposes the renderer tree only; process-wide `main` and `windows` routing belongs to the MCP tool.
- An `<iframe>` cannot run an Electron preload/`contextBridge`, so the bridge is delivered over a `MessagePort` RPC instead. Main mints a `MessageChannelMain` port pair **per board**; the renderer brokers a one-time handshake — it requests a port on mount and, on the iframe's `load`, transfers `port1` into the frame with explicit `targetOrigin: "board://<host>"`. Thereafter the board talks **directly** to a main-process handler over the duplex port (the host is out of the data path). A small in-board shim (`src/board-shim.ts`, built as a self-contained browser IIFE) rebuilds the `window.persephone` surface over the port and is inlined into served board HTML `<head>` by the `board://` handler — so `window.persephone` exists synchronously before the first author script. Port-dependent calls made before the handshake queue, then flush on connect.
- `execute(commandLine, opts)` — thin client over `command-runner.ts` in the main process. Returns an `IExecuteHandle` (buffered: `getText`/`getJson`/`getBytes`; streaming: `on("stdout"|"stderr"|"exit"|"error")`, `write`, `kill`). `opts.name` gives a job a caller-chosen name — the re-association key for `getJobs()` (below). The same main-process command runner backs `app.proc.execute()` in scripts.
- Integration tier: `openRawLink(href, opts?)` (optional `{ editor }` requests a specific editor — e.g. `"md-view"` — routed via `ILinkData.target`), `notify(msg, type)`, `openFileDialog` / `saveFileDialog` / `openFolderDialog`, and `readFile(path, opts?)` / `writeFile(path, data, opts?)` (relative paths resolve against the board root; text or `base64`; a sanctioned persistence primitive that avoids shelling a script).
- Process retention (busy boards): by default, everything a board spawned is tree-killed when its iframe unloads (page navigation or board reload). `setBoardBusy(true)` opts out — main keys job sinks by the owning `BoardEditorModel` id (stable across mounts) and keeps a busy owner's jobs when the port is disposed; the model itself survives navigation as an invisible ownership handle, so page/tab close (or app quit) still kills everything. The renderer is the authoritative busy holder (shim → host-frame `postMessage` → model → IPC mirror to main). On re-open the board reinitializes itself: `getBoardBusy()` (carried in the port handshake) and `getJobs()` — live jobs including previous board lifetimes, re-associated by the `execute()` `name`, control-only (kill/stdin work; no output streaming, output produced while unloaded is dropped). The Boards panel shows a green "running" dot for busy boards; a cross-window page move kills a busy board's processes.
- Theme/tokens: `--p-*` CSS variables are injected into the served HTML `<head>` at serve time by the `board://` handler, so the first paint is themed (no white flash). Live theme switches are pushed host→board over the port. Also available as `persephone.theme` / `persephone.tokens` (snapshots) and `persephone.getTheme()` / `persephone.getTokens()` (live). `persephone.onThemeChange(cb)` fires on every switch.

**Reload & failure reporting:** Boards do not auto-reload; the manual **Reload** toolbar action and `pages[i].editor.reload()` remount the iframe to pick up edited files. Each load starts a fresh `ui.log` (reset to a single "board loaded" line, so the log only ever holds the current board lifetime — clicking Show-log never opens an empty page). Load failures funnel into that `ui.log` and a toast; the main process reports navigation failures, the shim reports CSP and uncaught author errors, and a handshake watchdog flags a board whose bridge never connects.

**Board structure:** `board-manifest.json` (identity marker — descriptive metadata only, no behavior-driving or trust fields), `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`, `board-base.css` (shared base: page defaults + themed scrollbars, plus an opt-in `.p-*` chrome layer carrying the app's control metrics), optional `scripts/` folder, optional `icon.svg`/`png`/`ico` (shown in tab, boards tree, sidebar).

**Chrome parity:** `board-base.css` carries an opt-in class layer — `.p-toolbar`, `.p-btn` (+ variant modifiers), `.p-input` / `.p-select`, `.p-sep`, `.p-spacer`, `.p-toolbar-title` — whose metrics are ported from the app's own `uikit/Toolbar.tsx`, `Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx` and `tokens.ts` and expressed through the `--p-*` contract. It exists because boards are agent-authored: an agent left to invent its own chrome reliably produces a bar half again too tall (comfortable-looking vertical padding on a control) painted on `--p-panel`, a *content* surface, rather than the darker `--p-bg-dark` the app's chrome uses. The layer also encodes the app's control-size split, which is the failure that survives an author getting the bar height right: a toolbar control is the **small** tier (24px, 12px text — every editor toolbar in the app passes `size="sm"`), while the 26px medium size belongs on a page or in a dialog. `.p-btn` therefore defaults to 26px but takes the small metrics automatically inside a `.p-toolbar`, with `.md` as the escape hatch — a bar of medium buttons looks plausible in isolation and only reads as oversized next to the app's own chrome, so it is not a mistake an author catches by looking at the board alone. Opt-in by class rather than by element, so a vendored library's own controls — av-grid, flatpickr, tom-select, all loaded *after* `board-base.css` — keep their styling. The stylesheet is **copied at creation, not linked**, so it is a snapshot: changing it affects new boards only, and an existing board keeps the copy it was created with until someone overwrites it.

**Lifecycle & open-by-link:** `app.boards` is the renderer Object Model API for board lifecycle — `createBoard` / `createDemoBoard` / `openBoard`, plus registration, rename, and published-catalog operations. Its invariant is *the API requests, the user's dialog click grants*: scripts can drive the discover→download→review→register→update lifecycle but cannot self-trust. The `boards.*` call paths expose this lifecycle to agents. A board is opened through the canonical `openRawLink` pipeline.

**Published catalog:** boards published to a GitHub repo (`andriy-viyatyk/persephone-boards`) can be discovered and installed in-app. The main-process `published-boards-service.ts` fetches the raw `boards-manifest.json` (24h-gated, cached for offline use, and `isSafeBoardId`-guarded so a traversal/separator `id` never becomes an install path); a `board-download-service.ts` streams the per-board release ZIP with an incremental sha256 verify. On the renderer, `published-boards.ts` holds the catalog reactively, and `board-install.ts` / `board-install-registry.ts` / `board-updates.ts` handle the sha256-verified download → extract → registry-record install (which trusts *nothing* — the code lands on disk inert for review), in-place folder-swap updates and rollbacks that never destroy a working board, and silent update detection. Installation and properties both flow through the **Board Info editor** (`editors/board-info/`); registration is always the separate `showTrustBoardDialog` consent step, so an installed catalog board is indistinguishable from a locally-authored trusted board once registered. A catalog entry may declare a **screenshot** — a bare file name, guarded like the `id` because it is interpolated into a raw URL, and resolved to a URL as the catalog leaves the service rather than stored with it. It is shown on the catalog surfaces, loaded directly from the repo, and excluded from the release ZIP; see [editors.md](editors.md) for the full contract.

**Discovery & switching:** Boards are listed wherever a `BoardsTree` is rendered — a shared, fully-expanded tree (folders compacted VSCode-style; `BoardsTreeView.ts` over the pure `boards-tree-build.ts`) fed from the trusted-boards registry. Three surfaces share it: the **Explorer-sibling "Boards" panel** (`BoardsSecondaryView`, backed by `ExplorerEditor` exactly like Search, scoped to the Explorer root), the global **"Tools & Editors → Boards" tab** (`TrustedBoardsListView.ts`, all trusted boards across roots), and the **in-board toolbar** switcher popover. Boards are pinnable alongside built-in editors — pins are one unified ordered list over the `pinned-editors` setting (`pinned-items.ts`, boards stored as `board:<root>`). The Explorer also adds an "Open Board" trailing button on `board-manifest.json` rows; the row's normal click still opens the JSON in Monaco. An open board carries its own Persephone toolbar (`BoardToolbar`): Reload, Show-log, the full board path (click → switcher popover), a Properties button (→ Board Info), and a File Explorer button that opens the sidebar Explorer rooted at the board's parent folder. Opening a file whose mask a not-yet-installed catalog board claims adds a `"+"` segment to the editor switch (`Text | +`) that leads to the Board Info install screen. The "Tools & Editors" sidebar panel has an "Open in new tab" button that opens the full-page **hub** (`editors/tools-hub/`), whose "Search boards" tab browses the published catalog; pin affordances everywhere are gated to *standalone* boards (`isBoardStandalone` — a file-viewer board that needs a file is not pinnable).

**MCP automation:** Boards expose `pages[i].editor.*` for snapshots, interactions, evaluation, reload, and secondary-frame selection. Board pages appear in `pages` with `editor: "board-view"` and a `selectedBoard` field.

**Recommended components** in `boards-assets/`: a catalog of 11 vetted libraries — av-grid (the default data grid; **no skin**, it reads `--p-*` itself), plus 10 with pre-built skins (Tabulator, Chart.js, Flatpickr, Tom Select, marked/highlight.js, Mermaid, Split.js, SortableJS, Tippy.js, native `<dialog>`). Described in `boards-assets/manifest.json`; adoption playbook in `boards-assets/README.md`.

## Design Principles

### 1. Core First
Keep the core text editing experience fast and lightweight. Heavy features load on-demand.

### 2. Async Imports for Editors
```typescript
// CORRECT - async import preserves code splitting
const getArchiveModule = async () =>
    (await import("../editors/archive")).default;

// WRONG - synchronous import increases main bundle
import archiveModule from "../editors/archive";
```

### 3. Container with Building Blocks
persephone provides UI building blocks (toolbar, editors, grouped pages). Users bring their own integrations via Node.js/npm — the app doesn't need built-in database or API integrations.

### 4. Consistent Editor Structure
Every editor follows the same pattern:
```
/editors/[name]/
├── index.ts              # EditorModule registration (factory + matchers; required native View)
├── [Name]Editor.ts       # EditorModel subclass — state, lifecycle, business logic
├── [Name]BodyView.ts      # Native body (when the editor has an embeddable body)
├── [Name]Body.tsx         # Only for the Excalidraw vendor island under editors/draw/
└── components/           # Editor-specific (optional)
```

## File Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| React island | PascalCase.tsx | `ExcalidrawIsland.tsx` (draw only) |
| Model/State | PascalCase.ts | `PagesModel.ts`, `GridViewModel.ts` |
| Utility | kebab-case.ts | `csv-utils.ts` |
| Types | kebab-case.d.ts | `page.d.ts`, `settings.d.ts` |
| Index | index.ts | `index.ts` |

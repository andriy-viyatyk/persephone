# <img src="assets/icon.png" width="38" /> Persephone

**Persephone** is a developer notepad for Windows — built with Electron, Monaco Editor, and a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime. It extends the classic tabbed text editor with specialized viewers, a scripting engine, and an MCP server that lets AI agents drive the UI.

## Key Features

### Monaco Editor
Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and search/replace for 50+ languages. Drag tabs between windows for multi-monitor workflows. Side-by-side grouping and a full diff editor for comparing files.

### Specialized Editors
Beyond text: JSON/CSV grids with sorting and filtering, Markdown preview, Mermaid diagrams, SVG/HTML preview, PDF viewer, image viewer, a structured notebook, todo lists, force-directed graphs, Excalidraw drawings, and an HTTP Rest Client.

### Scripting Engine
Write and execute JavaScript or TypeScript directly in a tab. Scripts access open documents via the `page` object, the application via `app`, and have full Node.js access for file I/O, HTTP requests, and npm packages. A Script Library with autoload support lets you extend the application — add context menu items, hook into events, and automate workflows.

### Event System
An extensible event channel system (`app.events`) lets scripts subscribe to application events — file explorer context menus, browser bookmarks, and more. Autoload scripts register handlers at startup that persist for the session.

### AI Agent Integration (MCP Server)
A built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) HTTP server lets AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) create pages, execute scripts, display diagrams and grids, and manipulate documents — all programmatically. Enable with a single checkbox in Settings. See the [MCP Setup Guide](docs/mcp-setup.md).

### Built-in Web Browser
Browse the web in a dedicated tab with profiles, incognito mode, Tor routing, bookmarks, and DRM video support. Links from Markdown and Monaco open in the nearest browser tab automatically.

### Browser Automation *(experimental)*
Automate the built-in browser from scripts using `page.asBrowser()` — click elements, fill forms, extract text, run JavaScript, manage tabs, and wait for dynamic content via a CDP-powered API. AI agents can drive the browser directly through MCP browser tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, and more) without writing a script.

# Agent Tools

The **Agent Tools registry** is Persephone's *executable memory* for AI agents. Instead of re-writing (and re-debugging) the same ad-hoc integration script every session — read an Azure DevOps task, query a SQL database, check an inbox, call a cloud CLI — an agent registers the working script **once** as a reusable *tool*. From then on, any MCP-connected agent discovers and runs it in a single call. The debugging cost of an integration is paid once, and the working artifact persists across sessions and across agents.

> **Target audience:** This guide is for users who want to understand, manage, and trust toolsets. For AI agents that build tools, the `persephone://guides/tools` resource and the `CLAUDE.md` inside each scaffolded toolset are the authoring references.

It complements the [Mneme knowledge base](./mneme.md): Mneme is *knowledge* memory (searchable documents), the tools registry is *executable* memory (runnable tools).

## Concepts

### What is a toolset?

A **toolset** is an ordinary folder on disk identified by a `tools-manifest.json` file in its root. One toolset declares **one or more tools** (an Azure DevOps toolset naturally holds `get_task`, `list_my_tasks`, … sharing the same auth code). A toolset folder contains:

| Part | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **Manifest** | `tools-manifest.json` — declares the toolset name and its tools (name, description, command, parameters). |
| **Scripts** | The programs the tools run, in **any language** (`.py`, `.js`, `.ps1`, `.sh`, …). They run as real OS processes with your privileges. |
| **Secrets** *(optional)* | A `.env` file at the folder root holding secret values (API tokens, connection strings). |

Each tool has an id of the form `<toolset-name>/<tool-name>` (e.g. `azure-devops/get_task`). The toolset **name in the manifest** is authoritative — not the folder name — so a toolset keeps its identity when the folder is copied or renamed.

### The registry is agent-facing

Unlike most editors, the tools registry is used mostly *by AI agents over MCP*, not directly in the UI. Agents discover tools with `tools.search`, run them with `tools.execute`, and — when a tool fails — fix the script and retry. The Persephone UI is where **you** stay in control: registering, inspecting, and removing toolsets.

### Toolset trust gate

Because a tool runs a program with your full user privileges, **a toolset must be registered before its tools are discoverable or runnable** — and *registering a toolset is the same act as trusting it*. There is one list: registered ≡ trusted.

Registration is deliberately a **user-only** decision — an agent can never silently register a folder. It happens in exactly two ways:

- **Agent-initiated** (the `tools.createToolset` call path, or an agent asking to register a folder copied from elsewhere) → Persephone shows a **"Register this toolset?"** confirmation dialog:

  > *"An AI agent wants to register a toolset. Once registered, its tools run as programs on your computer with your full user privileges — headlessly, whenever the agent calls them, and after the agent edits them, with no further prompt. Only register toolsets you created or fully understand."*

  The dialog lists the toolset name, its folder path, and each declared tool. **Register toolset** trusts and enables it; **Cancel** leaves the folder created but not runnable.

- **User-initiated** — you click the **Open Toolset** icon on a `tools-manifest.json` in the **File Explorer**. If the folder isn't registered yet, the same confirmation dialog appears (because that icon can be clicked on any folder you're browsing, including a foreign one); confirming registers it and opens it.

This is stricter than the [Boards](./boards.md) trust gate on purpose: a board is a *visible* artifact you look at, whereas a registered tool later runs **headlessly** whenever an agent calls it — and re-runs after the agent edits it — so registration is your one natural checkpoint on that capability.

- Registration is **remembered across restarts** (stored in `%AppData%\persephone\data\trustedTools.txt`).
- Matching is **per exact folder** — there is no inherited/parent trust (each toolset is registered individually).
- Removing a toolset from a management panel **unregisters** it (its tools stop being discoverable/runnable); the folder on disk is untouched.

> Only register toolsets you created or fully understand — registering lets the toolset's scripts run programs and access files with your Windows user account's privileges.

## Managing toolsets in the UI

### The per-toolset editor

Opening a toolset shows a read-only **toolset view** with:

- The toolset name, description, and author, and a **Registered** chip.
- **Open Folder** — opens the toolset's folder in a File Explorer panel so you can read or edit its scripts and manifest.
- **Open Log** — opens that toolset's execution log (`tools-execution.log`) in a tab, so you can see what its tools actually ran and printed. (If no tool has run yet, Persephone tells you there's no log.)
- A card per declared tool — its description, command, parameters, required environment-variable **names**, and any runtime `requirements`. If the manifest has errors, they're listed here instead.

### Where to find toolsets

- **File Explorer** — rows for `tools-manifest.json` files show an **Open Toolset** button (wrench icon) directly in the row. Click it to register (if needed) and open that toolset. Clicking the row itself still opens the JSON in Monaco.
- **Boards panel → Tools** — open the **Boards** panel from the File Explorer header, then flip its inner switch from **Boards** to **Tools**. This lists every registered toolset under the current Explorer root. Click one to open it.
- **Tools & Editors panel → Tools tab** — the sidebar **Tools & Editors** panel has three segments: **Built-in Editors**, **Boards**, and **Tools**. The **Tools** tab lists *all* registered toolsets across every location. Click one to open it; right-click for **Remove** (unregister).

## Using tools from an AI agent (MCP)

The whole registry is reached through `call` object-model paths — discovery, execution, refresh,
toolset creation, and unregistration:

| Call path | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `tools.search` | Discover registered tools and return complete definitions, including input schemas and required environment-variable names. |
| `tools.toolsets.refresh` | Re-read edited manifests and scripts. |
| `tools.createToolset` | Scaffold a toolset and show the user registration confirmation. |
| `tools.unregisterToolset` | Revoke registration for an exact toolset root without deleting its folder. |
| `tools.execute` | Run a tool by id, with `args` matching its input schema. |

Run a discovered tool with `tools.execute(toolId, args)`. Tool
arguments arrive on stdin as JSON; failures include stderr, exit code, and the toolset folder path
so the agent can repair the tool and refresh the registry. These operations still run with the
user's privileges and never bypass the registration gate.

To unregister a toolset, first inspect `tools.toolsets` and pass its exact `root` value to
`tools.unregisterToolset(root)`. Persephone removes the toolset from search and execution before
the call returns, without deleting or changing its folder. No confirmation dialog appears because
unregistration only removes permission. An unknown, empty, non-string, or already-unregistered
root is rejected and the error lists the currently registered roots.

### How a tool passes data back

A tool script reads its `args` from stdin and returns its result on stdout using a sentinel marker:

- Print the result on its own line as `##PERSEPHONE_RESULT##<json>` — the **last** such line wins, so progress logs and third-party-library chatter on stdout are harmless.
- If the script prints no marker at all, its whole trimmed stdout becomes the result as plain text.
- `stderr` is returned as diagnostics; a non-zero exit code is treated as a failure.

### Secrets and portability

- **Secrets** live in a `.env` file at the toolset folder root; the manifest lists only the **names** of required variables. Persephone injects the values into the tool's process at run time. `.env` values **never** travel through MCP — `tools.search` reports names only.
- A toolset is a **self-contained folder** — copy it to another machine and register it there. Each tool's free-text `requirements` field (a Python version, pip packages, a CLI) tells you what to provision on the new machine. Secrets travel only if you copy `.env` along with the folder — delete `.env` when sharing a toolset with someone else.

### Using the registry from scripts

The registry is not a direct `app.tools` property, but the same live object model is available to
scripts through [`app.call()`](./scripting/api/app.md#callpath-options). A script can search and execute a
registered tool, refresh the registry, scaffold a toolset, or unregister one:

```javascript
const matches = await app.call("tools.search", { args: ["inbox", 5] });
const result = await app.call("tools.execute", {
    args: ["mail/get_inbox", { limit: 10 }],
});
await app.call("tools.toolsets.refresh");
await app.call("tools.unregisterToolset", {
    args: ["C:/path/from/tools.toolsets"],
});
```

Tool execution still runs with your user privileges. `tools.createToolset` writes the starter
files and shows the existing registration confirmation; it never registers or trusts a toolset
without your approval. Keep credentials in the toolset's `.env` file rather than in `args`, which
may be recorded in local tool logs. See the [scripting API reference](./scripting/api/page.md#editor-facades) for the
page editor surfaces that let agents inspect the Tools & Editors hub and an individual toolset.
`tools.unregisterToolset` does not show a confirmation or delete files; only call it with a root
you intend to remove from the registry.

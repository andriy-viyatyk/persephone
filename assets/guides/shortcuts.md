# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Application (Global)

These shortcuts work regardless of which editor is active.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+N` | New tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` | New window |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open — paste file path, URL, or cURL command |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Save As |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close tab |
| `Ctrl+F4` | Close tab (alternative) |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Previous tab |
| `Ctrl++` | Zoom in |
| `Ctrl+-` | Zoom out |
| `Ctrl+0` | Reset zoom |
| `Ctrl+Mouse Wheel` | Zoom in/out |
| `Ctrl+Alt+]` | Next theme (also works with focus inside a board) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+[` | Previous theme (also works with focus inside a board) |
| `F1` | Open the User Guide, or the guide for the active editor when one is available |
| `F5` | Run script (JavaScript or TypeScript) |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste clipboard content into a new viewer tab — bitmap images (screenshots, Snipping Tool) open in the **Image Viewer**; rich HTML (Teams / Outlook conversations, Word or Excel selections, PowerPoint pictures, web-page selections) opens in the **HTML viewer**. Images are intercepted anywhere; the HTML fallback stands down when the destination handles the paste itself, including a text editor, input, grid, or other component (those paste normally). |

`F1` is handled when focus is outside a Monaco editor. When no guide is mapped to the active editor,
it opens the About page at the guide contents.

Collapsing a folder deselects everything inside it. Selecting a folder together with items inside it acts on the folder only.

### File Operations

Every operation below applies to the whole selection when more than one row is selected.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy the selected file(s)/folder(s) to the Windows clipboard |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cut the selected file(s)/folder(s) to the Windows clipboard (not on the tree's root) |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from the Windows clipboard into the selected folder (or the selected file's parent, or the root) |
| Drag | Drag the selection out to Windows Explorer or Teams (native OS drag; not on the tree's root). Dragging onto another folder in the tree instead opens a Move/Copy/Cancel dialog. Dragging a row outside the selection carries only that row |
| `Delete` | Delete the selected file(s)/folder(s) (shows the confirmation dialog) |
| `F2` | Rename the selected file/folder (single selection only) |

These file-operation shortcuts are disabled while typing in the panel's search box, and Ctrl+C/X/V require a real file-system folder (not archive, Mneme, or link panels).

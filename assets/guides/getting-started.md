# Getting Started

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/andriy-viyatyk/persephone/releases)
2. Run the installer or extract the ZIP
3. Launch persephone

The installer's **Additional Options** page offers three checkboxes:
- **Add "Open with persephone" for files to Explorer context menu** (checked by default)
- **Add "Open with persephone" for folders to Explorer context menu** (checked by default) — lets you open a folder straight into persephone from Explorer; it opens as a new tab with the File Explorer panel rooted at that folder
- **Register as default browser** (unchecked by default)

Passing a folder path on the command line opens the same way. If you're upgrading from an older version that had the (now removed) "Set as default app for text files" option checked, that upgrade releases those file associations — each extension reverts to whatever app previously handled it.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andriy-viyatyk/persephone.git
cd persephone
npm install
npm start
```

## First Launch

When you first open persephone, you'll see a clean, simple interface:
- Tab bar at the top
- An empty text editor

The application looks like a simple notepad by default. To access additional features (recent files, folder bookmarks, settings, and About with its guide browser), click the **persephone icon** at the top-left corner of the tab bar — the Menu Bar slides in from the left. Click anywhere outside it to dismiss it.

## Basic Operations

To browse the shipped guides in the About page, choose **About** from the Menu Bar, or press `F1`. You can
also press `F1` when focus is outside a Monaco editor; it opens the matching guide for the active
editor when available, or the guide contents otherwise.

### Creating a New File
- Press `Ctrl+N` or click the + button in the tab bar
- Click the dropdown arrow (▾) next to the + button to create a page with a specific editor. The default items are:
  - **Open Folder** — Pick a folder; opens a new tab with the File Explorer panel rooted at that folder
  - **Script (JS)** — JavaScript file for scripting
  - **Script (TS)** — TypeScript file for scripting
  - **Drawing** — Excalidraw-based drawing canvas
  - **Grid (JSON)** — Grid editor for JSON data
  - **Grid (CSV)** — Grid editor for CSV data
  - **Browser** — Built-in web browser (or pick a specific profile / incognito)

  The dropdown shows your **pinned** editors. You can add or remove items from the **Tools & Editors** panel in the sidebar (see [Tabs & Navigation](./tabs-and-navigation.md#tools--editors)).

### Opening Files
- Press `Ctrl+O` to open file dialog
- Drag and drop files onto the window
- Use recent files in the sidebar

### Saving Files
- Press `Ctrl+S` to save
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` to Save As
- Unsaved changes show a dot on the tab

### Closing Files
- Press `Ctrl+W` to close current tab
- Click the X on the tab

## Language Selection

persephone automatically detects the programming language based on file extension (.js, .py, .json, etc.).

To manually change the language:
- Click the language icon button on the left side of the tab
- Select the desired language from the dropdown list

On a page with no file extension in its name — a new `untitled` page, for example — the language
you choose here also decides which editors the page toolbar offers. Markdown and HTML offer
**Preview**, JSON, CSV and JSONL offer the matching **Grid**, Mermaid offers **Mermaid**, and XML
offers **SVG Preview**. A named file keeps using its extension, so a `.xml` file stays in the
Text Editor.

## Checking for Updates

persephone automatically checks for updates once every 24 hours. When a new version is available, you'll see a notification.

To manually check for updates:
1. Click the app button (persephone icon) in the top-left corner to open the Menu Bar
2. Click **About** (the info button) to open the About page
3. Click "Check for Updates"

"Check for Updates" also refreshes the catalog of [boards published by the project](./boards.md#published-boards-catalog--discover-install-update), so a newly published board or board update shows up immediately instead of waiting for the next automatic check.

The About page also shows:
- Current application version
- Electron, Node.js, and Chromium versions
- Available boards — the number of boards currently published in the catalog
- Links to download the latest version and report issues
- The in-app guide browser, with guide contents, release highlights, and resource links

## Changing the Theme

persephone includes 9 color themes (6 dark, 3 light) inspired by VSCode:

1. Click the app button (persephone icon) in the top-left corner to open the Menu Bar
2. Click the Settings button (gear icon) to open the Settings page
3. Click a theme card to switch instantly

**Dark themes:** Default Dark, Solarized Dark, Monokai, Abyss, Red, Tomorrow Night Blue
**Light themes:** Light Modern, Solarized Light, Quiet Light

You can also cycle through themes with `Ctrl+Alt+]` (next) and `Ctrl+Alt+[` (previous).

Your theme preference is saved automatically and applied on next launch.

The Settings page also has a "View Settings File" button to open the raw `appSettings.json` for manual editing (`%APPDATA%\persephone\data\appSettings.json`). Edits to the file — made by hand, by a script, or by an AI agent — take effect immediately, with no restart needed, including settings that start or stop something (the MCP server, Mneme). The file carries a header comment plus a per-setting comment (accepted values, default, and any gotcha — for example, changing a port only moves a running server if you also toggle the feature off and on). Persephone rewrites these comments on every save, so they always match the current version.

## Window Behavior

Closing persephone's last window hides it into the notification tray by default, keeping background services (the MCP server, Mneme) running. The tray icon stays visible while the app is running — left-click it to toggle window visibility, or use its menu (**Show App**, **Quit**).

To make closing the last window quit the app instead:

1. Click the app button (persephone icon) in the top-left corner to open the Menu Bar
2. Click the Settings button (gear icon) to open the Settings page
3. In the **Window Behavior** section, uncheck **"Keep running in the tray after closing the last window"**

Settings file key: `window.close-to-tray` (boolean, default `true`). The tray's **Quit** action always exits persephone, regardless of this setting.

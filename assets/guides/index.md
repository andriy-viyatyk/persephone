# persephone User Guide
A powerful notepad for developers, built with Monaco Editor.

## What is persephone?

persephone is a Windows Notepad replacement designed for developers. It combines the simplicity of Notepad with powerful features from VS Code:

- **Monaco Editor** - The same editor that powers VS Code
- **Syntax Highlighting** - 50+ programming languages
- **JavaScript & TypeScript Execution** - Run scripts to transform content
- **Multiple Editors** - Grid view for JSON/CSV, Markdown preview, Drawing canvas, Rest Client, Video Player, and more (PDF viewing is available as an opt-in [board](./boards.md) install)
- **Tab Management** - Multiple files with drag-and-drop, grouping, and compare

## Quick Start

1. **Open a file**: File → Open or drag a file onto the window
2. **Edit**: Just like any text editor
3. **Save**: Ctrl+S to save

- File encryption
- Full Node.js access in scripts
- **AI scripting** — call Claude directly from scripts via `ai.ClaudeSession` (multi-turn conversations, tool use)
- AI agent integration — connect external tools like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or ChatGPT to control persephone via HTTP (MCP)
- **Boards** — build fully custom HTML-page applications inside a project folder; call backend scripts (any language) via `persephone.execute()`, and theme the UI automatically with the `--p-*` CSS-variable contract; AI agents can author and test boards over MCP. You can also discover and install ready-made boards published by the project, with safe updates and rollback
- **Agent Tools registry** — turn a working integration script into a reusable, parameterized tool (any language) that AI agents discover with `tools.search` and run with `tools.execute` over MCP; user-gated by a registration/trust dialog
- **Git integration** (optional, off by default) — Git Tree editor for browsing commit history, and a Git Diff editor switch for any tracked text file
- **Mneme knowledge base** (optional, off by default) — index folders of Markdown for full-text and semantic search; browse and edit documents in-app, and let AI agents read, search, and maintain the knowledge base over MCP

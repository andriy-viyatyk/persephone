/**
 * Main process file content search service.
 *
 * This module is only the host: it owns the worker lifecycle and relays messages between the
 * renderer and a `search-worker` thread that does the actual walking. The walk itself lives in
 * `search-worker.ts` precisely so it never runs here — synchronous fs I/O on the main-process
 * event loop freezes the window message pump and makes cancellation unreachable.
 *
 * One worker per sender (window). Cancelling — whether from the panel, a changed query, a new
 * search, or the window closing — is `worker.terminate()`, which stops the walk immediately
 * instead of waiting for a flag the blocked worker would never read.

 * whose module loader cannot be relied on to resolve an entry inside it. `fs.readFileSync` is
 * asar-aware in the main process, so reading the file here always works — the same approach
 * `board-protocol-service.ts` uses for the board shim.
 *
 * Cached for the process lifetime in a packaged build (the file cannot change under us). In DEV
 * the cache is skipped, because the dev server rebuilds the worker on every edit WITHOUT

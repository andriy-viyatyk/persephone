/**
 * AiVision — the interface an object in the app object model implements to describe itself to an
 * AI agent. See doc/epics/EPIC-083.md, design decisions 1, 4 and 7.
 *
 * Shared between processes: the renderer's script wrappers implement it, and so do the
 * main-process nodes (`windows`, `main`). Nothing here may import from either process.
 *
 * Two halves per node:
 * - the *kind-level* shape (`kind`, `summary`, `members`, `help`) — the same for every instance,
 *   cheap, and deduplicated per MCP session by `kind`;
 * - the *instance-level* shape (`children()`, `restricted()`, `index()`, `summarize()`) — what
 *   exists under this node right now. The object enumerates it itself and is responsible for doing
 *   so without side effects; the resolver never probes getters it was not asked for.

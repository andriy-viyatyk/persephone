/**
 * The fallback adapter for a dialog no `viewId` factory covers.
 *
 * Without it, one unregistered dialog makes `dialogs[i]` — and `children()`, and every attention
 * block — throw for *all* open dialogs, so a single missed registration blinds the agent to the
 * whole stack. `EditLinkDialog` was exactly that miss (found by EPIC-084's `/review`, after
 * US-1298's inventory put the count at 13).
 *
 * A dialog reached this way is still answerable: `cancel()` is the one action that works without
 * knowing anything about the model, and it is what an agent needs to unblock the app. Fields the
 * dialog might carry are deliberately NOT reflected over — an unknown dialog could be holding a
 * credential, and guessing at its members is exactly what the privacy rule forbids.

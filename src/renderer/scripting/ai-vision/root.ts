const SCRIPT_HELP = `
script.execute(code, pageId?, language?) runs code in the renderer execution context. The available
script globals are app, page, io, and ai; app exposes application services, and page is the selected
page's script global. If pageId is omitted, execution targets the active page; pass a page id to
target that page explicitly. language is optional and may be "javascript" or "typescript"; TypeScript
is transpiled without type checking.

The last expression is returned as text. The result always contains text, language, isError, and
consoleLogs. console.log, console.info, console.warn, and console.error are captured in consoleLogs.
The \`code\` argument must be a string: a wrong code-parameter type is an MCP/tool error. A syntax
or runtime error thrown by a string of code is not an MCP/tool error; the call succeeds with
isError: true, error text, and any consoleLogs captured before the failure. Renderer failures include
the error message and submitted-script stack frames after Persephone's internal frames are removed.
Side effects performed before an error or timeout remain performed.

This is full-privilege renderer/Node.js execution with no sandbox. Code can read and write files,
spawn processes, access the network, and change the application. require() is context-bound, but
otherwise has full Node.js access. A renderer bridge request waits up to 30 seconds; a timeout does
not cancel JavaScript that is already running. A newly opened blocking renderer dialog may instead
return pending with an attention instruction; answer it and re-read the relevant state.

The call resolver may cut long result text or a console argument at maxLength (20,000 by default).
Raise call's maxLength to return the rest. For detailed API operations, use the app and page paths
and their descendants; use helpSearch when you need to discover another path. This help is the
execution contract for script.execute. The separate main.script.execute path runs settings-gated
main-process code.

Inside a renderer script, app.call(path, options?) resolves the renderer tree only; it cannot
resolve the MCP router's main.* or windows[i].* paths. It returns a bounded plain value, accepts
args or value (not both), and never returns hints or resolver metadata.

This is Persephone's live object model. Every path here has the same name in scripts
(script.execute(code)): "pages[0].content" is "app.pages.all[0].content" there.

Common paths:
  pages.logView.push([...])   SHOW the user output (markdown, a grid, mermaid, code, progress) or
                              ASK them a question — the agent's output channel; see its $help
  pages["<id>"].content       text of a specific page
  pages[0].editorSwitches.switchTo("grid-json")  switch the page, then use pages[0].editor.addRows(5)
  pages.showPage("<id>")      activate a page
  tools.execute               execute a registered tool (use args for tool id and JSON arguments)
  tools.toolsets              inspect current registered toolsets, including invalid and shadowed entries
  tools.toolsets.refresh()    refresh the whole registered-tool registry
  tools.createToolset         scaffold a toolset and offer the existing user registration prompt
  pages[0].tab.highlight("tab-language")  point the user at one page's tab control ("where is …?", "show me …")
  script.execute(code)        run renderer JavaScript or TypeScript; see script.$help
  main.script.execute(code)   run the separate settings-gated main-process scripting path
  <path>.$help                long-form help for any node

Rules: arguments for the last segment go in "args" (a JSON array); assignments go in "value";
the path itself takes only short JSON literals. Unknown members return the valid member list.

Agent Tools are a root-only call namespace, not an app/script member. Search exposes environment
variable names only; credentials remain in the toolset's .env and never in a call result. Execution
returns the structured result, including advisory argWarnings when inputSchema is not satisfied;
the schema is descriptive and the tool script remains authoritative. On failure, use toolsetRoot
and stderr to repair the tool, call tools.toolsets.refresh(), and run it again. Tool output uses
the last ##PERSEPHONE_RESULT##<json> marker; unmarked stdout becomes logs or resultText and stderr is
diagnostics. Toolset refresh is whole-registry only, and createToolset never registers without the
existing user confirmation; a declined registration can be offered again with the same call.

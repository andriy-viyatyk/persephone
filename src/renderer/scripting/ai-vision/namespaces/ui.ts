An individual page tab and its controls are owned by pages[i].tab. For Log View output use pages.logView; scripts also have the global ui facade. Use `guides.screens` or `guides.screens.index` for the app's screen and control documentation; use `ui.elements` for live selectors and `ui.highlight` to point at a named control. For a walkthrough, use ui.guide.step(target, message) for each curated or owning-node target; it points at the control and waits for the user to press Skip or Next, then call ui.guide.end() after the final step.",

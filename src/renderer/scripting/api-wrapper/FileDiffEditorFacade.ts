elements is the page-scoped inventory of the two revision-picker buttons and the shared text controls
that apply to this host. The picker buttons open popovers containing the revision tree. text-compare-left
enters compare mode when a comparable grouped left page exists, and text-show-resources opens extracted
HTML resources when the host language is html. The File History panel is owned by page.panels under
git-diff-revisions; its git-diff-revisions-refresh and git-diff-revisions-tree descendants are panel
controls and are not duplicated in this editor inventory.`;

Image viewer facade with source state, PNG/original export, Drawing Editor, and clipboard actions.
elements is the page-scoped curated inventory of image-save, image-open-draw, and image-copy.
image-save is hidden until an image URL is loaded; when opened, its transient image-save-menu
contains Save as .png and Save original. The save actions use the native Save Image dialog.
image-open-draw opens the current image in the Drawing Editor, and image-copy copies a PNG to the
clipboard. The viewport's zoom, pan, fit, and keyboard gestures are not named facade elements.
Reading elements does not activate a page; highlight activates the owning page and waits for its
layout before drawing.`;

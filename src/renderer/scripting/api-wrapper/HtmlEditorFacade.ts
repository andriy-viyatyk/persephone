const HTML_EDITOR_HELP = `Access via pages[i].editor after narrowing editor.id to "html-view".
HTML preview facade with host-chrome controls text-compare-left, text-show-resources, html-copy,
and html-more. The html-image-menu is transient and is opened by html-more; it contains Save as
PNG, Open in Image View, and Edit Image. Save as PNG opens the native Save Image file dialog.
The page-tab popup menu exposes Save, Save As..., Rename, Show in File Explorer, Copy File Path,
Open in Browser, Decrypt, Encrypt or Change Password, and Make Unencrypted. Rename File, Unsaved
Changes, and password dialogs are transient and are accessed through dialogs. elements.visible
reports DOM presence and layout, not whether a capture control is enabled; capture controls remain
visible while capturing is true. Drawing/Excalidraw page actions are opened by the image actions.

HTML preview content is rendered in a sandboxed srcdoc iframe. page.editor.elements reports host-chrome controls only; its selectors stop at the renderer document and do not cross into the iframe. Use window.screen.snapshot() for DOM inside the preview iframe; it merges the preview accessibility tree when Chromium reports at least three AX nodes, while the html property remains the source content rather than the iframe DOM.`;

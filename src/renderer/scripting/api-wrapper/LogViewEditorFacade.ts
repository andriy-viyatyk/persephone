const LOG_VIEW_HELP = `Access via pages[i].editor after narrowing editor.id to "log-view", or read pages.logView for the fixed MCP Log View writer.
The facade is model-backed: entries are fresh deep-copied snapshots, actions do not inspect views, DOM controls, clipboard state, or live model arrays, and pages[i].content remains the raw JSONL content because Log View has a content host.
When attached, entries is [] for a valid empty Log View, entryCount is its real count including 0, error is the actual parse error or undefined for a valid parse, and showTimestamps is the real boolean including false. Detached host-backed state is undefined; false, 0, "", null, and [] are never used as absence markers.
push accepts one plain string, one valid flat entry object, or an array of either. A plain string is shorthand for one log.info line. It validates and normalizes the documented flat entries, returns immediately with fresh entryIds and dialogIds arrays (including [] for empty input), and supports string shorthand, log levels, text/Markdown/Mermaid, JSON/CSV grids, progress, and all six input dialog types. A grid's content is always a STRING: JSON by default, or CSV text with contentType: "csv" beside it — without that discriminator CSV text is parsed as JSON and rejected. These exact entry and dialog examples remain in the ui-push resource.
Log View dialogs are inline entries, not renderer dialogs: they do not appear in dialogs[0], the agent cannot answer them, and the user must answer them in the Log View page. Read dialogResult(id): it is undefined only when that entry no longer exists, { id, status: "unresolved" } while button is undefined, or { id, status: "resolved", entry } once button exists, including falsy button and answer fields.
pages.logView.push() is non-blocking, including when it creates input dialogs: it returns entryIds
and dialogIds, and an unresolved dialog raises call attention until the user answers it in Log View.
There is no automatic user-response timeout; a pending dialog means the user has not answered it.
The call result omits fields that are absent; it does not replace an absent field with null.
The curated elements are page-scoped. Prefix selectors log-dialog-button and log-dialog-checkbox locate control families; highlight passes highlightOptions: { all: true }. A highlight result's count is total matches and highlighted is the number actually ringed or capped by the overlay. Output open/copy controls are locations only because their handlers remain view-owned; use entries or push for model-backed data.

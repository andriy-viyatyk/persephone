/**
 * SVG commit-graph cell for the Git Tree component (; ported to av-grid in
 * ).
 *
 * A dumb painter of one row's swimlane slice (computed by `swimlane-layout.ts`). Under av-grid a
 * `render` hook supplies cell *content* inside the library's own pooled `.avg-data-cell`, so
 * the absolute box, the forwarded `className`, the background, the borders, and `overflow: hidden`
 * belong to the cell, and the hover and selection tints land on this cell exactly as they land on a
 * text cell.
 *
 * The SVG is drawn at a constant width (independent of the cell box) and clipped by the cell:
 * shrinking the column slides the clip edge, never rescales the graph. The
 * two declarations that make that true live in `GitTree.css`.

/**
 * Build the swimlane renderer for a fixed `maxColumns` (the constant graph width across all rows).
 *
 * ## The markup's formatting is a performance contract, not a style choice
 *
 * av-grid re-renders a cell only when the dirty set names it, its row or its column
 * (`render/renderInfo.ts`) — so a hover move dirties two rows and a selection change dirties the
 * affected cells. This column's content is a pure function of its row, so on those repaints the
 * string is *identical*, and av-grid's string path skips the write:
 * `if (el.innerHTML !== rendered) el.innerHTML = rendered`.
 *
 * That comparison reads `innerHTML` back, which **re-serializes** the parsed subtree, so it matches
 * only when what we wrote is what the serializer emits. Which means: explicit closing tags (never
 * `/>` — the serializer writes `></path>`), double-quoted values, `viewBox` cased exactly so (the
 * parser adjusts `viewbox` and the serializer emits the adjusted name), dashed property names
 * (`stroke-width`, not the camel-case property name), a stable attribute order, and no character that gets
 * escaped on the way out. Break any of those and the graph column re-parses on every hover move for
 * nothing.
 *
 * A string rather than an element for the same reason: av-grid's element path has **no** equality
 * guard at all — it does `textContent = ""` then `appendChild` unconditionally — and `CellContext`
 * does not hand the renderer its cell, so a renderer cannot memoize on its own.
 *
 * (av-grid 2.2.2 makes the skip exact, comparing against the last string assigned rather than a
 * re-serialization. The rules above stop being load-bearing then, but stay correct.)

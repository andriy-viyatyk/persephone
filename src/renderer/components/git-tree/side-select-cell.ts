/**
 * The L/R side-select cell for the Git Diff "Revisions" panel, rendered by av-grid.
 * av-grid Av-grid provides the cell container used by this selector.
 *
 * Two small toggles per row — **L** (the diff's `from`) and **R** (its `to`) — in a fixed,
 * sticky-left status column. The Unstaged row passes `showLeft: false` (the diff `from` is never
 * the working tree), so only R renders, with a same-width placeholder keeping the R glyph
 * column-aligned with the commit rows.
 *
 * ## Why spans with no listeners, rather than the buttons this replaced
 *
 * av-grid's cells are pooled and recycled, and its string path is the only one with an equality
 * guard: the element path does `textContent = ""` then `appendChild` **unconditionally** on any
 * repaint that touches the cell. A real element with listeners would therefore be detached
 * whenever anything dirtied its row — move the pointer one row and a focused toggle is gone, with
 * keyboard focus thrown to `<body>`.
 *
 * So this follows the library's own pattern for its own checkbox cell: emit markup carrying a
 * resolvable attribute, and let the host resolve the click by delegation. av-grid states the rule
 * in `view/DataCell.ts` — *"`data-type` is what `GridInteractions` resolves the click by; the
 * element carries no listener of its own, because it is pooled"* — and in `view/GridInteractions.ts`,
 * where per-cell listeners in a pooled grid are called *"not merely slower … unsound: an element
 * that was a header cell on one frame is a data cell on the next"*.
 *
 * Spans rather than `<button>`s for a second reason: `GridInteractions.focusRoot` deliberately
 * declines to take focus when a press lands inside `input, textarea, select, button, a,
 * [contenteditable]`, so a real button would steal focus from the grid root and kill arrow-key
 * navigation until the user clicked a cell.
 *
 * The markup carries **no hover or focus state**, so the `innerHTML !== rendered` guard keeps
 * hitting and a hover repaint of this column costs one string comparison per cell.

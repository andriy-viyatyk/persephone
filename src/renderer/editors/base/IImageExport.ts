/**
 * Capability implemented by editors that can export their rendered content as an
 * image (Mermaid preview, SVG preview, Image viewer).
 *
 * Consumed by the editor's "Save as PNG" toolbar action and by its script facade
 * (`savePngToFile`). The implementation is host-independent and headless — it does
 * not require a mounted view, so export works even when the page is not the active
 * tab. The shared helpers in `core/utils/image-raster.ts` do the canvas work.

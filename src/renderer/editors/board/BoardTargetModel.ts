/**
 * `IBrowserTarget` adapter for a Board (EPIC-034 / US-730; re-homed onto the
 * `<iframe>` in EPIC-037 / US-773), letting the existing `browser_*` MCP automation
 * tools drive a board's frames.
 *
 * A board has no navigation and no agent-creatable tabs, but it DOES have multiple
 * frames — the main view plus each declared secondary (sidebar) view (EPIC-044 /
 * US-858). Those frames are surfaced through the tab abstraction the interface already
 * provides: `tabs` enumerates the main frame + one tab per declared secondary view,
 * `switchTab` selects which frame subsequent commands drive, and `cdp(tabId?)` /
 * `focusWebview` / `insertText` all honor the active (or an explicit) tab. Each frame
 * has its own CDP registration keyed `${model.id}/${tabId}` (main → `main`, secondary →
 * `board-secondary:<viewId>`), resolved to the specific board frame by its `?v=` nonce.
 *
 * The single-target guarantee the old code enforced (v1 drove only the main frame) is
 * replaced by explicit selection: `activeTabId` defaults to `main`, so nothing changes
 * until an agent selects a secondary view. Because a secondary frame is only attachable
 * while its sidebar panel is mounted, selection (and a readiness gate before every
 * command) auto-expands the panel and WAITS until the frame has registered for CDP — the
 * agent never sees an "iframe not mounted" error.
 *
 * Navigation and add/close-tab throw a clear error — the dispatcher turns it into a
 * JSON-RPC error. The whole iframe-vs-webContents difference stays below this seam (the
 * agent only ever passes `pageId` + a tab index).

/**
 * Pure builder for the boards tree (EPIC-036 / US-759). Turns a finite set of board-root
 * paths into a nested tree of containing folders down to each board, with VSCode-style
 * single-child folder compaction. No filesystem walk — the input is the known
 * trusted-board list, so the whole tree is built in memory and rendered fully expanded.
 *
 * Two modes share one builder:
 *  - **single-root** (`baseRoot` set): each board's path is relativized to `baseRoot`, which
 *    becomes the tree's top. Used by the Explorer-sibling panel + the in-board toolbar popover.
 *  - **multi-root** (no `baseRoot`): each board's absolute path is split into segments, so the
 *    tree is a forest grouped by containing folder. Used by the global Tools & Editors tab.
 *
 * The companion `BoardsTree` component renders these nodes via the UIKit `Tree`. A
 * `BoardTreeNode` is structurally an `ITreeItem` (value/label/items), so the Tree consumes it
 * directly without a trait; the extra `kind`/`root` fields drive the component's renderItem +
 * callbacks.

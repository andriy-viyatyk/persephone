/**
 * Announce a pointer press this document cannot see, so open overlays dismiss.
 *
 * A press inside a separate frame — the browser editor's `<webview>` guest, a board's
 * cross-origin iframe, or the HTML viewer's sandboxed iframe — fires no `pointerdown` here,
 * so `PopoverView`'s outside-click
 * listener never runs. A menu therefore stayed open over the very content the user was
 * clicking, and in the browser editor the guest covers nearly the whole page, leaving almost
 * nowhere to click to dismiss it. Each frame reports its own presses (the webview preload
 * sends `guest-pointerdown`; the board shim posts `board:interact`; the HTML viewer's
 * injected script posts `html:interact`) and this replays the outside-click those listeners
 * are waiting for.
 *
 * `pointerdown` specifically, and this is the part that rotted: dismissal used to be
 * `mousedown`, so the HTML viewer's ping dispatched one. `PopoverView` moved to `pointerdown`
 * — deliberately, because `mousedown` is a compatibility event a drag gesture may suppress
 * (see the note in `PopoverFloatingView.onMount`) — which left the ping firing an event
 * nothing listens for any more.
 *
 * `document.body` is the target because it is outside every popover root by construction, and
 * no other renderer code listens for `pointerdown` on the document, so this dismisses
 * overlays and does nothing else.

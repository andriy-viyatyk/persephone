# UIKit — Component Authoring Guide

This folder contains Persephone's new component library (`src/renderer/uikit/`).
Every component in this folder **must** follow these rules. Read this file before creating or modifying any component here.

Default user-visible text in a UIKit component comes from `uikitText()`, never a literal.

---

## Folder structure

Each component lives in its own subfolder:

```
uikit/
  tokens.ts              ← design token constants
  index.ts               ← public exports
  Button/
    ButtonView.ts
    index.ts
  Input/
    InputView.ts
    index.ts
  ...
```

Components use a co-located `Component.css` stylesheet imported by the owning `ComponentView.ts`.
Plain CSS is scoped from the required `[data-type="component-name"]` root and uses the existing
`data-part` vocabulary for stable internal regions. All UIKit implementations are framework-free;
do not add React faces or runtime-generated CSS.

### Which virtualization engine to use

**New code uses av-grid through the `uikit/DataGrid` boundary.** Fixed-height surfaces construct
av-grid's `RenderGrid`; surfaces whose row height is measured from nominated content use
`MeasuredRowGrid`. Both are vanilla engines: cell renderers return an `HTMLElement`, the engine
owns the scroll shell and its nine regions, and consumers own their cell subtrees directly. Do
not import av-grid directly from a consumer.

---

## Rule 1 — Data attributes for state (mandatory on every component)

Set `data-type` and `data-*` state attributes on the root element. Never express interactive state via CSS class names.

```tsx
<button
    data-type="button"
    data-disabled={disabled || undefined}
    data-variant={variant}
    data-size={size}
>
```

**`data-type` is required on every component.** Use kebab-case matching the component name.
It enables DOM inspection in DevTools and reliable querying by AI agent scripts:
```js
document.querySelectorAll('[data-type="button"][data-disabled]')
```

Pass `undefined` (not `false`) when a boolean attribute is inactive — `data-disabled="false"` still matches `[data-disabled]`.

### Standard state attributes

| Attribute | Values | When to use |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `data-type` | kebab-case name | **Always** — every component's root element |
| `data-name` | free-form string | optional caller-supplied debug label (`name` prop). Never used for styling. |
| `data-disabled` | present / absent | component is disabled |
| `data-selected` | present / absent | item is selected |
| `data-active` | present / absent | item is focused / highlighted |
| `data-drop-active` | present / absent | item is the current drag-and-drop target |
| `data-checked` | `"true"` / `"false"` / `"mixed"` | checkbox or toggle state |
| `data-state` | `"open"` / `"closed"` | expandable or floating element |
| `data-orientation` | `"horizontal"` / `"vertical"` | layout direction |
| `data-variant` | e.g. `"ghost"` / `"danger"` | visual variant |
| `data-size` | `"sm"` / `"md"` / `"lg"` | size variant |

### Debug naming via `data-name`

Every primitive accepts an optional `name?: string` prop. When set, the value is
emitted as `data-name="…"` on the same element that carries `data-type`. This is a
debug-inspection aid — it never affects styling, state, or behavior.

```tsx
const panel = createPanelElement({ name: "url-bar-wrapper", flex: 1 });
// → <div data-type="panel" data-name="url-bar-wrapper">
```

**When to set `name`** (in call sites):
- Multiple instances of the same primitive in one tree (especially `Panel`,
  `IconButton`, `Splitter`, `Divider`).
- Any `IconButton` — the `<svg>` child doesn't reveal the action.
- Any element that participates in cross-component selectors (`closest`,
  `querySelector`) — name doubles as a stable hook.

**When to skip:** purely structural one-off Panels where the surrounding
`data-type` chain already identifies the element.

**Authoring requirement:** every new UIKit primitive MUST accept `name?: string`
and emit `data-name={name}` on the same element as its `data-type`. Pass
`undefined` (not `""`) when unset, so the attribute is omitted. Destructure
`name` before the rest spread so the attribute is emitted only once.

### Style state via static CSS attribute selectors

Put state selectors in the component's co-located stylesheet. Do not use Emotion or a runtime
style generator.

```tsx
import "./Button.css";

export function Button({ size = "md", disabled, name, label }: ButtonProps) {
    return (
        <button
            data-type="button"
            data-name={name}
            data-size={size}
            data-disabled={disabled || undefined}
        >
            <span data-part="label">{label}</span>
        </button>
    );
}
```

```css
@layer uikit {
    [data-type="button"] {
        color: var(--color-text-default, currentColor);
        border-radius: var(--radius-md, 0px);
        font-size: var(--font-base, 13px);
    }

    [data-type="button"][data-size="sm"] {
        height: var(--size-control-sm, 24px);
    }

    [data-type="button"][data-disabled] {
        opacity: 0.4;
        pointer-events: none;
    }
}
```

Static selectors begin at the component's `[data-type]` root. Use established `data-part` names
for structure and preserve direct-child relationships where DOM shape matters. Use
`var(--color-...)` and the app token families (`--space-*`, `--gap-*`, `--radius-*`, `--size-*`,
`--font-*`) rather than literals. Scalar runtime inputs use component-prefixed custom properties
on the consuming element with a fallback; finite state uses `data-*` attributes. The public
component still omits `style` and `className`, even though its implementation may set an internal
custom property on its own raw root. Do not render `<style>` from a component for keyframes: use a
stable `persephone-<component>-<animation>` name in the co-located stylesheet.

---

## Rule 2 — Controlled components (no internal state for primary value)

Never use `useState` for the component's primary value. Models own all state.

```tsx
// WRONG
function Input({ defaultValue }: { defaultValue?: string }) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(defaultValue ?? "");
    ...
}

// CORRECT
function Input({ value, onChange }: { value: string; onChange: (v: string) => void }) {
    ...
}
```

**Allowed** internal transient state:
- `isHovered`, `isFocused` — visual-only feedback
- `isOpen` — dropdown open/closed when not controlled externally
- A **gesture anchor** — the reference point a range gesture extends from (`Tree`'s multi-select
  anchor). It is not the value; it only says where the next range starts.

When a gesture needs to compute a *new* composite value the component doesn't own — a
Ctrl/Shift-click producing the next selection **set** — read the current value back through the
props predicate (`isSelected` per visible row), compute the result, and emit it
(`onSelectionChange`). The component keeps the derivation because it alone knows the presentation
order; the consumer keeps the state.

---

## Rule 3 — Trait-based data binding (list/collection components)

Applies to: **Select, MultiSelect, ListBox, Tree, SegmentedControl, and any component that takes a list of items.**

Accept `T[] | Traited<T[]>` for items/options props. Call `resolveTraited(items, KEY)` once at the top of the component — result is always the component's native array type.

```tsx
import { resolveTraited, Traited, TraitType } from "../../core/traits/traits";
import { TraitRegistry } from "../../core/traits/TraitRegistry";

export interface IOption {
    label: string;
    value: string;
    icon?: IconRef;
}

const OPTION_KEY = TraitRegistry.register<TraitType<IOption>>("select-option");

export interface SelectProps<T = IOption> {
    items: T[] | Traited<T[]>;
    value: IOption | null;
    onChange: (v: IOption) => void;
}

export function Select<T = IOption>({ items, value, onChange }: SelectProps<T>) {
    const options = resolveTraited<IOption>(items, OPTION_KEY);
    // options is IOption[] — consume normally from here
}
```

**Rules:**
- Never add `getLabel`, `getValue`, `getIcon` accessor props — removed at point of conversion.
- The `TraitRegistry.register()` call lives in the component file — one key per component.
- Scalar-value components (`Input`, `Checkbox`, `TextField`) do not use this pattern — only list/collection props.

---

## Rule 4 — Roving tabindex (keyboard-navigable widgets only)

Applies to: **Toolbar, Tree, ListBox, SegmentedControl, Tab bar, and similar widgets.**

- Only one item has `tabIndex={0}` at a time (the active item); all others get `tabIndex={-1}`
- Arrow keys move focus within the widget; Tab / Shift+Tab exits it entirely
- Callers are unaware of this — it is internal behavior only

Do not apply to simple lists that are not keyboard-navigable widgets.

---

## Rule 5 — Focus trap (modal dialogs only)

Applies to: **all components that render a blocking modal overlay.**

When the modal opens:
- Move focus to the first focusable element inside
- Tab / Shift+Tab cycle only within the modal
- On close, return focus to the element that was focused before the modal opened

Does **not** apply to non-modal side panels or popovers that do not block background interaction.

---

## Rule 6 — Native composition

Dynamic children are created as native elements or `VanillaView` instances. Use `this.child(view)`
for lifetime ownership, `KeyedList` for keyed collections, and `fillSlot` for a view-owned content
region. Static DOM can be built directly with `document.createElement` and `append`; do not invent a
React descriptor registry or wrapper component for native composition.

---

## Rule 7 — Static CSS and native DOM (mandatory)

All renderer code **must not** use Emotion; the packages are not installed. UIKit props use the
native contracts in `shared/dom-props.ts`, and component views apply them with DOM properties and
`applyRestProps`. Runtime `style` and `className` are not part of the UIKit component contract.

**When a layout need can't be expressed by existing props:** extend the native component's
prop surface, do not work around the rule. The right answer is a new explicit prop, not
"this one place needs `style=`".

**Why:**
- **Consistency.** Every screen in Persephone uses the same native primitives with the
  same defaults. No one-off styling drift.
- **Inspectable contracts.** Explicit props and data attributes make intent legible to native views,
  scripts, and agent tooling. Do not introduce a descriptor registry for UIKit composition.
- **AI agent legibility.** With layout expressed in props, an agent can read intent from the view
  contract and its data attributes without consulting generated styles.

**When this rule may be relaxed:** when scripts need to ship custom styles into UIs, a curated
escape hatch (e.g. `style?: Pick<CSSProperties, "color" | …>`) may be added for a future script UI
API. Until then, no escape hatch.

**Application chrome (`src/renderer/ui/`)**

Files in `src/renderer/ui/` that render the Persephone application's one-of-a-kind chrome
surfaces (page tab strip, sidebar, navigation bar, etc.) use their own co-located static CSS. Their
visual layout is unique to Persephone, will not be reused elsewhere, and should not become a new
UIKit primitive solely to express chrome-specific geometry.

Such files MUST use co-located static CSS. Runtime `style={…}` and `className=…` remain allowed
only on their own local elements (plain `<div>`s, etc.) for chrome layout. They MUST still:

- Use only UIKit components (`Button`, `IconButton`, `Tooltip`, `Divider`, `Panel`, …) for
  primitive rendering — no imports from `src/renderer/components/basic/` or
  `components/form/` for new code.
- Apply Rule 1 (`data-*` for state) on their own elements.
- Avoid passing `style={…}` or `className=…` to UIKit components (that's still a TypeScript
  error).

This exception does **not** apply to anything that could plausibly be reused (forms,
dialogs, settings panels, list rows). For those, the strict rule still holds — extend a
UIKit primitive instead of styling around it.

**Foundational compositional primitive guidance**

`RenderGrid` is a multi-region composition: cells, sticky bands, and sticky corners are owned by
the av-grid shell, while overlay hosts are added through its explicit surface. Styling belongs to
the grid stylesheet or to the host's own scoped stylesheet; a cell renderer owns only its cell
subtree. The Omit-style enforcement (`extends Omit<HTMLAttributes<…>, "style" | "className">`)
still applies to primitives that wrap a single HTML element (Button → button, Input → input).

When in doubt: this exemption is for **foundational compositional primitives with
multiple styleable regions**, not a general escape hatch. New UIKit primitives that
wrap one HTML element follow the strict Rule 7 contract.

---

## Rule 8 — Model-view architecture for complex components

UIKit components are native `VanillaView` classes. Keep small views direct and readable; once a
component grows past the small-and-readable threshold, move stateful behavior into a model and
keep DOM construction and event wiring in the view. Follow the model-view pattern documented in
[`/doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md`](../../../doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md).

### Thresholds (from the standard doc)

**Migrate to model-view when any of the following hold:**

- State transitions or business logic make the view body hard to follow at a glance
- Several controls share state or derived values
- Effects, timers, subscriptions, or async work need explicit cancellation

**Stay with plain hooks when:**

- It only creates a small DOM subtree and wires a few native events
- Its state is a single, local DOM projection
- It is a thin wrapper over another native view

### What the migration looks like

The pattern moves state transitions and reusable logic into a model; the `VanillaView` owns DOM,
native listeners, bindings, and disposal. See the standard doc for the full pattern, including:

- `TComponentState` — the state primitive
- `TComponentModel` — the base class with `init()`, `dispose()`, and derive-on-write model fields
- `createComponentModelDriver(props, ModelClass, defaultState)` — the explicit native lifecycle driver

### Naming and file layout

Co-locate the model with the component. Inside the component's UIKit subfolder:

```
uikit/ListBox/
    ListBoxView.ts        ← Native view
    ListBoxModel.ts       ← Model (TComponentModel subclass)
    ListBox.story.ts
    index.ts
```

Model classes are suffixed `Model` (matching the rest of the codebase — `GridPageModel`,
`NotebookViewModel`, `ImageViewModel`).

### Why this matters in UIKit specifically

UIKit primitives are reused across the entire app. A component with tangled state transitions,
subscriptions, and async work is harder to extend in follow-up tasks. The model-view split keeps
each new feature additive — a new method on the model rather than more lifecycle work hidden in a
large DOM builder.

It also unlocks alternative views over the same model later (e.g. a dense vs. comfortable
ListBox skin) without touching the logic.

---

## Rule 9 — Vanilla view authoring

Every UIKit component exposes a framework-free `VanillaView`. The detailed model contract is in
[`/doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md`](../../../doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md); this
section is the mandatory checklist for a class extending `VanillaView`.

Import `VanillaView`, `KeyedList`, and `SubtreeSwap` directly from their files under
`uikit/shared/`; these lifecycle and structural helpers are internal and are not public barrel
exports from `uikit/index.ts`.

### Lifecycle and ownership

- The constructor creates the stable root and may construct the model driver and view-owned
  state needed for the initial prop pump. Whatever the constructor touches, the constructor must
  have created; whatever `onMount()` creates, only `onMount()` and later may touch. It must not
  install listeners or subscriptions, measure layout, or start timers. A resource created in the
  constructor registers its cleanup with `own()` immediately; `onMount()` registers cleanup for
  resources it creates. This wording matches the deliberate create → claim → mount pattern used
  by `child()` and avoids treating ownership registration as child-DOM misuse.
- Every view used by a constructor slot declares a **public** constructor. The base constructor is
  protected, so inheriting it is not a valid public constructor contract.
- `mount()` is where child DOM and bindings are built. The owner attaches `root` before calling
  `mount()` when the view may measure itself. `update(props)` always stores the latest props;
  before mount it does not call `onUpdate`, and `onMount()` renders from the stored props.
- Ownership and mounting are separate operations. `claimViewOwnership(view)` and `this.child(view)`
  only register lifetime ownership; they do not call `mount()`. Every claimed child must be mounted
  exactly once before its root is handed to a structural inserter or expected to render. For a view
  claimed directly rather than through `this.child()`, the usual order is create → claim → mount →
  return or insert, and the owner must also dispose it explicitly.
- `dispose()` is idempotent and disposes owned children first, then registered resources in FIFO
  order, then `onDispose()`. It attempts the complete cleanup snapshot and rethrows the first
  error afterward. Registration order is load-bearing. It makes the view inert but does not remove
  `root`; the adapter or structural helper that attached the root owns detachment.
- `bind()` is legal from `onMount()` onward. It applies once immediately, then subscribes, and
  returns an idempotent release handle. A binding to a fixed state source may rely on final view
  disposal; when the source can be replaced, retain the handle and release it before binding the
  replacement. Capture the source identity in the apply callback and ignore a callback that was
  already in flight when the handle was released. The selector must read only the reactive state
  argument — never a lazy getter or directly-assigned model field — so every value it returns is a
  dependency observed by the state subscription. The apply callback must tolerate the disposed
  view because a state notification may still visit a listener removed during that same notification
  pass.
- A class extending another view class must extend `VanillaView` directly. This keeps every view
  inside the lifecycle checks; composition belongs in owned child views.
- Outside the constructor and `onMount()`, do not discard a `bind()` handle. A bind in a repeatable
  method must retain its release handle and call it before binding a replacement source.

### DOM, events, and state

- Build structure with `document.createElement`, `append`, and explicit properties/attributes.
  Static, code-owned `innerHTML` is allowed when genuinely clearer, but never interpolate runtime
  data into markup. `replaceChildren` is limited to a region owned outright by the view, never a
  `KeyedList` or other structural-helper container.
- Use semantic elements, `data-type` on the root, `data-name` for public debug names, and the
  established `data-part` vocabulary for stable internal regions. Keep interaction state in
  `data-*` attributes and co-located static CSS; do not reintroduce `className` as state.
- Use native DOM event types (`Event`, `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, and so on), not React
  synthetic event types. The model remains reusable by both views and must not query the DOM.
- Store DOM references on the view and clear them during disposal. `bind` is for synchronized
  state-to-DOM projections; direct DOM work remains appropriate for structure, input feedback,
  attributes, focus, measurement, and other imperative operations.
- A vanilla-driven model uses `createComponentModelDriver`. Move behavior to explicit model
  methods, `setProps`, view lifecycle hooks, or cancellable async work. Keep prop-to-state seeding
  behind an identity guard in `setProps`, because prop pumping runs on every update.

### The props-pump convention

Props are construction-time configuration. Live data belongs in a child-owned `bind()` to the
relevant model state or in a targeted setter; `update(props)` is not a render pass. Store every
update-path `onX` callback as a bound field created once. A construction-time menu or toolbar
descriptor may use an inline arrow because it is built once, but update-path callback identity must
not churn.

Selectors must return direct state references, primitives, or plain objects of those values — never a
fresh array. Use `KeyedList` for dynamic collections and `SubtreeSwap` for one conditional child.
The full convention, including `compareSelection` semantics, the small-model whole-state exception,
and the rejected `VanillaView.update()` equality gate, is in
[`/doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md`](../../../doc/standards/model-view-pattern.md#the-props-pump-convention).

#### State ownership of the virtualization engine

The model state, geometry, dirty-set processing, and paint scheduling stay inside av-grid; UIKit
views hold only the engine instance and the imperative model capability they need. Do not recreate
that state or a second paint loop in a UIKit model. The measured companion owns only its row-height
policy and DOM observation around the engine.


#### Prop-change detection in a vanilla-driven model

The question "did any of these inputs move?" does not go away. The answer is
`uikit/shared/deps-gate.ts`: the **model** publishes a fixed-length signature of everything its
rendered output reads, and the **host view** holds a `DepsGate` and calls it once, at the end of
`onUpdate`, after the driver has pumped props. `ListBoxModel.repaintSignature()` is the reference
shape.

Five rules, each of which has already bitten:

- **Fixed length.** `depsChanged` treats a length change as "changed", so a conditionally-pushed
  slot silently degenerates into "always repaint".
- **Gate after the pump, prime at the end of `onMount`.** Gating first compares a stale signature;
  never priming makes the first update repaint everything for nothing.
- **Compare the actual derived output at its ownership boundary.** When an output is derived only
  from a prop, the prop *is* the signal and identity-check that input before deriving. When the
  output is a normalized primitive or collection, maintain it synchronously and compare the plain
  field or direct reference that the consumer reads. `ListBoxModel.resolved`, `selectedKey`, and
  `TreeModel.rows` follow this rule.
- **Do not put reactive state in the signature.** A state change does not pump props in a vanilla
  driver, so a state slot is dead code. State-driven arms belong in `bind()`, and consequences of
  the model's own mutations belong at the mutation site.
- **A caller-owned selection travels through a callback's *identity*.** When a parent owns the
  selection and passes a predicate rather than a value — `MultiListBox` passes `isSelected` and never
  passes `value` — that predicate is the only slot that can carry the change. A stable bound method
  means checking a row moves no slot at all: the gate reports no change and the row keeps its old
  DOM until an unrelated input moves, so it self-heals on the next mouse move and reads as a
  rendering glitch rather than a missing repaint. Keep the predicate identity stable and carry the
  changing selection set as an explicit repaint signal (`MultiListBoxModel.isSelected` plus
  `selectedKeys`). A `revision` counter is not the fix — it is a proxy for a signal
  that already has a channel, and a forgotten bump has no compiler or runtime signal at all.

#### Never read a state-derived field from inside a `state.update` producer

Immer runs the producer against the *previous* state, and `this.state.get()` still returns it — so a
derived field or guard consulted there can therefore be computed from pre-write values, and the
failure is silent: the producer writes a plausible value that is one step stale.

Compute from explicit values **before** the update and assign the result inside the producer; read
the guards from the **draft**, which is the state being committed. `SelectModel.seedIndex` takes both
the item array and the search text as parameters for exactly this reason — its first version read
`loadedItems` from state, which is empty on the load path, so the highlight it exists to seed was
silently never applied.

#### A state-driven model in a vanilla view

`ListBox`'s inputs are all props, so its `DepsGate` in the host's `onUpdate` is the whole story.
`Tree` is the first converted component whose rendered output also depends on **reactive state**
(expansion, lazy-load flags, drag state), and props are the only thing a vanilla driver pumps.

**Two mechanisms exist, and the choice between them is not stylistic.** Ask what the state *feeds*:

| The state is… | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| a **child's prop** — the view's job is to push it down | one compound `bind()` on the fields, applying through a single `syncChildren()` | `MultiListBox` (`searchText`, `activeIndex`); `MenuView` |
| **internal** — the consequence is a render pass the children cannot express (root attributes included) | a `mutate()` funnel on the model calling one host-registered callback | `Tree` (expansion, lazy-load flags, drag state) |

Two secondary signals point the same way. Write-site count: `Tree` has ~8 across three files, so a
funnel that makes `grep "state.update"` return exactly one hit buys a checkable convention;
`MultiListBox` has two two-line setters in one file and the convention would be pure ceremony (its
acceptance criteria assert **2**, not 0, so a later reader does not "fix" it into a funnel). And
`bind` filters through `compareSelection`, so a no-op write costs nothing, where `mutate()` runs the
full consequence regardless.

Whichever you pick, **every path must call the same consequence.** `MultiListBox`'s select-all header
derives from `searchText` *and* from `props.value`, so narrowing the filter has to be able to flip it
with no prop change at all; a `bind` that refreshed only the input and the list would have rebuilt the
masked defect inside the task that removed one. And do **not** keep per-field guards
(`lastSearchText`, `lastActiveIndex`) in the parent: a guard maintained on one of two paths either
re-pushes forever or skips a needed push. Let the children's own gates absorb the duplicate.

For the internal case, the answer is **not** a state subscription:

- Every state write goes through one funnel on the model — `TreeModel.mutate()` — which writes the
  state and then calls a single host-registered callback (`onStateApplied`). `grep "state.update"`
  inside the component folder must return exactly one hit; that is what makes the convention
  checkable. A submodel gets a narrow entry point (`mutateState`) rather than touching `state`.
- **The consequence of a state write is to re-run the render pass, not to repaint the cells.** Root
  attributes can be state-derived, and `aria-activedescendant` is the worked example: its bounds
  check reads `rows.length` *and* its value reads `rows[i].value`, so a `collapseAll()` with a
  high `activeIndex` must *remove* the attribute and an in-range collapse must *rewrite* it. A
  grid-only repaint leaves the root pointing at an id that is no longer in the DOM.
- Keep `applyRestProps` off the state path. It removes and re-adds every `on*` listener on every
  call, rest props cannot have changed on a state write, and reinstalling the root's listeners
  during a drag is a hazard rather than churn.
- Re-prime the `DepsGate` from the state path. Immer gives the mutated slice a new identity, so a
  eagerly derived output has a new identity and the next props pump would otherwise repaint a second
  time. Priming is safe there precisely because that path just painted everything.

Why not a subscription **in that case**, concretely (all three points are about a state-driven
*render pass*; none of them argues against `bind()` for a field that is simply a child's prop):
`TOneState.update` dispatches synchronously, and unsubscribe replaces the listener array so an
in-flight dispatch can still call a listener removed during that pass, and a
state-driven blanket repaint masks missing prop dependencies: a prop missing from the signature
would appear broken only until the user expanded a node, then fix itself.

#### Scrolling after a change that resizes the content

av-grid's `RenderGridModel` has two scroll entry points and they are not interchangeable. `scrollTop`
is clamped to the scrollable extent, and the extent (`area.style.height`) is written **inside** the
next `RenderGrid` paint, on `requestAnimationFrame`.

- `scrollToRow(row)` — the row set has not changed. One frame faster, which keyboard navigation
  can feel.
- `scrollToRowAfterPaint(row)` — the caller has just changed the row set. Measured: expanding a
  folder and scrolling immediately lands at 600px where the target needs 1020px, silently, with
  nothing re-issuing the request. A `setTimeout(0)` does not help: it runs after the microtask that
  recomputes the geometry but before the frame that applies it.

The symptom of getting this wrong is not an error or a blank row — the list renders perfectly and is
simply scrolled to the wrong place.

**A parent therefore must not split "the rows changed" and "the highlight moved" into two state
writes.** The host picks its entry point from `contentChanged && activeIndex !== lastActiveIndex` in
one `onUpdate`, so one write means one push carrying both, and it chooses `scrollToRowAfterPaint`
correctly. Two writes give the second push `contentChanged === false` and it picks `scrollToRow`.
That survives by accident while the grid is still unmeasured — the engine's pending slot catches it —
and stops surviving the moment the row set changes on a measured grid. `SelectModel.commitLoaded`
assigns the seeded `activeIndex` in the same `state.update` as `loadedItems` for this reason, and
`openInto`/`closeInto` exist so a caller that must produce one write can compose draft mutators
instead of calling two setters.

#### Native slots inside a virtualized row

`ListBox` and `ListItem` use native `SlotContent` values: text, numbers, DOM nodes, or arrays of
those values. **`icon` is also native** — an icon is a registry name or a DOM node and never a
`IconName | Node`, so an icon is a registry name or a DOM node and never a framework element. The
av-grid's `RenderGrid` cell contract is `HTMLElement` and receives only DOM. Four guard rails keep
slot ownership safe:

- Decide **per slot**, not per row: an `IconName` becomes a DOM `svg` with no root; only a genuine
  native value goes through `fillSlot`. Never route strings through `fillSlot` for uniformity.
- A DOM icon node is **single-use**: appending it to a second host *moves* it and blanks the first.
  Build it at the point of use — never cache, memoise, hoist to module scope, or share one node.
  `tsc`, lint and the build are all blind to this, and the symptom is an icon disappearing somewhere
  *other* than the code being changed (this has occurred four times, once per caching mechanism).
  The fifth was different and is worth naming, because "never cache" alone did not prevent it.
  `TreeProviderViewImpl.iconCache` legitimately memoises one node per **href**, so no two rows ever
  want the same node at the same time — yet pooling still moved it: a cell that takes over a row
  steals the node out of the previous cell's host, and if that cell is later re-pointed at the same
  row it sees `directIconElement === iconElement` and skips the refill forever. **A cached node is
  only safe behind a guard that checks the host, not identity** — `node.parentNode === host` — because
  the host is the source of truth and identity is only a hint about it. `TreeItemView.setIcon` and
  `setTrailing` both check it.
- Roots are retained **per pooled element**, never per row. Pass `keepCellsAttached: true` when a
  cell owns state such as a nested scroller, iframe, or editor; ordinary eviction then hides the
  pooled element in place and preserves its subtree. The option is off by default because it trades
  DOM nodes for state. `ListBoxView` and `TreeView` set it explicitly, and `Autocomplete` inherits
  the ListBox setting; other consumers with retained child views must make the same opt-in. A
  settled scroll must create zero roots.
- `onCellAttached` means that a cell entered the active set. `onCellReleased` means that it left
  the active set and entered the pool, **not** that it was detached from the DOM: with
  `keepCellsAttached`, the element remains hidden in the document, and only pool overflow detaches
  it. Use these callbacks for bookkeeping such as measurement mappings, not slot cleanup.
- Never run a slot cleanup on eviction or on `onCellReleased` — only when a pooled wrapper changes
  kind and at final view disposal. Track created elements in a real `Set`, because an
  unmounted-but-undisposed root keeps its subscriptions alive on a detached tree.
- Key the caller's subtree by the cell key, so a recycled element remounts it rather than letting
  one row's state bleed into another's.

### Structural helpers and native slots

- Claim a child with `this.child(view)` exactly once. Ownership is enforced by the shared marker;
  an already-owned view throws. Use `this.listen` and `this.own` for cleanup, and register
  constructor-created resources before mount-created resources because disposal is FIFO.
- `KeyedList` validates all keys before mutation, removes and detaches deleted nodes, creates
  missing nodes, reconciles order with its cursor without re-inserting an already-correct node,
  then updates every record. `SubtreeSwap` owns one conditional root and inserts a replacement
  before disposing and detaching the old branch. Both helpers detach their managed nodes; this is
  deliberately different from `VanillaView.dispose()`.
- `PopoverView`'s `contentView?: (host) => IOwnedView` keeps the floating root's children native
  DOM. A content view must use this seam. The seam has two properties the prop's type does not show. **It never
  appends what the factory returns** — `PopoverFloatingView.onMount` only claims it with `child()` and mounts it, so the
  factory attaches its own DOM (`host.append(view.root)`) or the dropdown renders empty. And **it is
  not an update channel**: `PopoverFloatingView.onUpdate` forwards nothing to the content view, so
  the parent pushes the content's props itself, from its own single consequence, and keeps a *bare*
  reference to it — a second `child()` claim throws on the shared marker. `MenuView`'s
  `MenuContentView` reads its model live instead, which works only because nothing but state changes
  a menu's output; `SelectView` pushes typed `ListBoxProps`, because `items`, `emptyMessage`,
  `rowHeight` and the filter can all move with no state write.
- **A `contentView` whose content is more than one sibling must *adopt* the host as its root**
  (`super(props, host)`), not wrap it. `MenuContentView` and `AutocompleteContentView` both do.
  A real wrapper element becomes the popover's sole flex item, moving the `overflow`/shrink
  semantics down a level; a `display: contents` wrapper preserves layout but stops the children being
  *direct* children of `.popover-shell`, which a `:scope >` query and an agent reading the tree can
  both see. Adoption means the factory appends nothing — the view's own appends land on the host —
  so **the two factory shapes look different on purpose**: `SelectView`'s must `host.append` because
  a `ListBoxView` builds its own detached root, and `AutocompleteView`'s must not. The price of
  adoption is three writes the content view may never make on `this.root`, because
  `PopoverFloatingView` reasserts them on every update and wins silently: `dataset.type`, any
  `className` assignment, and `replaceChildren` (the resize handle is appended to that same root
  *after* the content mounts). Tag children instead. Name the three in the class comment — the
  failure mode is an attribute reverting one update later, not an exception. Adoption also inherits
  `.popover-shell`'s **layout** — `flex-direction: column`, plus `overflow: auto` unless the caller
  passes `scroll: false` — so a content view wanting any other arrangement must declare it in full.
  `display: flex` alone leaves the shell's `column` standing: that is what stacked the browser
  editor's collapsed-tab hover strip title above its close button and gave a fixed 28px-tall box a
  scrollbar (`editors/browser/BrowserTabsPanel.css`, `[data-tab-extension]`).
- `fillSlot` **owns the host element it is given.** Call it again to change the content; never run
  the previous cleanup first, and never write to that host directly (`replaceChildren`, `append`,
  `textContent`) behind its back. It replaces native content when the requested direct children do
  not already match, and preserves an exact node match in place; either path advances the fill
  generation, and a superseded cleanup is a no-op. Text content is deliberately not compared. When
  a view needs several nodes in one slot (an icon plus a label), pass an array of nodes or a
  one-shot `DocumentFragment`, so the children still land as direct children of the host and the
  host's own `gap` still applies. Do not reuse a `DocumentFragment`: appending it consumes its
  children, so it never matches a later fill.

### Converting an existing React component

- **Account for every field, not every prop.** The prop *interface* is usually carried over intact,
  so a diff of the type looks complete while a field the old JSX read is silently never forwarded
  to the vanilla view. Check the fields of item/data types too (`ISegment.label`, option shapes,
  row descriptors) — those are read inside the old render body, not named in the component's props,
  and are the ones that go missing. The symptom is not an error: the element renders with correct
  size, styling and handlers, and is simply empty.
- **A converted primitive that renders blank is a content bug, not a CSS bug.** Backgrounds are
  transparent on several variants, so an empty element is invisible while still being hoverable
  and clickable. Check the DOM for the missing child before reading the stylesheet.

See `uikit/PathInput/PathInputView.ts` for the complete working shape.

## Focus-aware list selection (shared contract)

Selectable lists share one focus-aware selection look (the Explorer file-tree behavior): a
selected/active row shows a subtle **gray** background when its list is **not** focused, and a
**blue** background + blue outline when the list **is** focused. This is pure CSS — no JS focus
state. It was built from three fragments in `shared/selection-style.ts`, which **no longer exists**
(EPIC-056 C3-7, deleted in US-1015); the table below records the shape each surviving copy took and
which fragment it descends from. It is gated by a container attribute:

| Fragment | Applied on | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `rowSelectionBase` | the **row**'s styled block (self-selector spread) | blurred base — `[data-selected]` → `background.light`, `[data-active]:not([data-selected])` → `background.message` |
| `focusSelectionOverride(rowSelector)` | the focusable **container**'s styled block | focused override for rows that are *descendants* of the container (e.g. `Tree` → `TreeItem`, `CategoryList` → its rows) |
| `rowFocusSelectionOverride(rowMatch)` | the **row**'s own styled block | focused override for a row primitive used *without* its own styled container (e.g. `ListItem` outside `ListBox`, `SelectableRow`) — matches whenever the row sits inside any focused-within `[data-focus-selection]` ancestor |

**The module is gone; there are now four independent per-component copies.** `ListItem.css` holds a
hand-translated `rowSelectionBase` + `rowFocusSelectionOverride` scoped to `[data-type="list-item"]`;
`TreeItem.css` holds the blurred base and `Tree.css` the focused override; `SelectableRow.css` and
`CategoryList` hold their own; and `ui/sidebar/FolderItem.css` carries the app-layer copy. Each
Each copy is scoped to its own component root, so they cannot collide.
The rule order *inside* each block is load-bearing, which is why a shared stylesheet was not worth
the cross-file source-order dependency.

**Two traps this split leaves behind.** First, `Tree`'s focused override lives on the *container*,
so its CSS selector must keep a `[data-type="tree"]` anchor — the Emotion original was scoped to the
component's generated class, and an unanchored translation becomes a global rule that paints any
`TreeItem` under any opted-in container, including one rendered through a `ListBox`'s `renderItem`.
Second, `TreeItem.css` deliberately does **not** carry `ListItem`'s `:not([data-drop-active])`
carve-out: Tree's override outranks its drop rule on specificity (0,5,0 against 0,2,0) rather than
on source order, so adding the exclusion would change behaviour rather than preserve it.

`FolderItem.css` belongs in `@layer app`, never `@layer uikit`, because the row is app-owned rather
than a reusable UIKit primitive.

**How a container opts in:** set `data-focus-selection` **and** `tabIndex={0}` on the scroll
container so `:focus-within` can trigger on click. `ListBox` does this for you via
`selectionStyle="focus"` (works even with a custom `renderItem`); `Tree` via its `focusSelection`
prop (or `keyboardNav`, which implies it). For a plain container you own, pass `tabIndex={0}` +
`data-focus-selection=""` directly on the container.

**The rows.** A row that rides a shared primitive (`ListItem`, `TreeItem`) already carries the
focus-mode CSS. For a **bespoke** row in editor code that should not duplicate selection CSS, wrap the
row content in the **`SelectableRow`** primitive — a layout-neutral `<div>` that composes
`rowSelectionBase` + `rowFocusSelectionOverride` verbatim and exposes `selected` / `active` props.
It is content-height (no percentage height), so a single child provides the layout; give that
child `flex={1}`/`minWidth={0}` where it must stretch, and size it to the grid `rowHeight` in a
virtualized list.

**Descendants that declare their own colors.** All three fragments paint only `backgroundColor`,
`color`, and `outline` on the matched row itself. Label text follows because it inherits the
row's `color` — but any descendant that sets a color of its own silently opts out of the state
change. A row primitive with such children must restate them under the same
`[data-focus-selection]:focus-within &[data-selected]` ancestor selector, so the rule activates
in exactly the states the container override does. `TreeItem` does this for its two: the chevron
(which sets `icon.default`) takes `icon.selection`, and the level guides (`border.light`) go
`borderLeftColor: transparent` — invisible against the highlight, rather than needing a guide
color that reads correctly against both the row and the selection background in every theme.
Both are targeted through plain child-hook classes (`.tree-chevron`, `.tree-indent`), which
express structure, not state, so Rule 1 still holds.

No new color tokens are needed — the look reuses `background.light` / `background.message`
(blurred) and `background.treeSelection` / `border.active` / `text.selection` / `icon.selection`
(focused), all defined in every theme.

**Multi-selection needs nothing extra.** The fragments key off each row's own `[data-selected]`, so
N selected rows paint correctly with no styling change — `[data-active]` stays singular (one
highlighted row). `Tree` supports opt-in multi-selection via `multiSelect` (Ctrl/Shift+click,
Ctrl+A, Shift+Arrow/Home/End/PageUp/Down): it stores **no** selection, derives the current set by
calling `isSelected` per visible row, keeps only a transient anchor, and emits the resulting set
through `onSelectionChange` for the consumer to store — Rule 2, with the range math staying in the
Tree because it alone knows the flat visible row order.

**A transient row state that must outrank selection.** `ListItem` also accepts `dropActive`, which
marks the row currently under a drag (`data-drop-active` → selection background plus a
`border.active` outline). Selection is persistent and drop-target is momentary, so the momentary
one has to win — but the focused-selection override is *more* specific by one attribute and would
otherwise swallow it. The fix belongs at the source, not in an `!important`: `ListItem` narrows the
`rowMatch` it hands `rowFocusSelectionOverride` with `:not([data-drop-active])`, so the two rules
are mutually exclusive by construction. Anything adding a similar transient state should carve it
out of the selection override the same way, and keep the exclusion in the row primitive where both
rules are visible together.

## Naming conventions

### Component names

Use the canonical naming table in this guide. Never use old names from
`src/renderer/components/`.

| Old name | New name |
|----------|----------|
| `SwitchButtons` | `SegmentedControl` |
| `ComboSelect` | `Select` |
| `ListMultiselect` | `MultiSelect` |
| `List` | `ListBox` |
| `Popper` | `Popover` |
| `PopupMenu` | `Menu` |
| `TreeView` | `Tree` |
| `Chip` | `Tag` |
| `CircularProgress` | `Spinner` |
| `FlexSpace` | `Spacer` |
| `TextAreaField` | `Textarea` |
| `OverflowTooltipText` | `TruncatedText` |

### Prop names

Use predictable, self-documenting names. An AI agent reading the prop should understand it without opening the file.

| Concept | Use | Avoid |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Current value | `value` | `val`, `selectedValue`, `currentItem` |
| Change handler | `onChange` | `onValueChange`, `onSelect`, `handleChange` |
| Disabled state | `disabled` | `isDisabled`, `enabled` (inverted) |
| Loading state | `loading` | `isLoading`, `pending` |
| Open/closed | `open` | `isOpen`, `visible`, `show` |
| Open change handler | `onOpenChange` | `onToggle`, `setOpen` |
| List of options | `items` | `options`, `data`, `list` |
| Click handler | `onClick` | `onPress`, `handleClick` |
| Icon element | `icon` | `iconLeft`, `startIcon`, `leftAdornment` |
| Placeholder text | `placeholder` | `hint`, `hintText` |
| Debug identifier | `name` (→ `data-name`) | `id`, `debugId`, `label` |

### Boolean props

- Name as adjectives, not questions: `disabled` not `isDisabled`, `loading` not `isLoading`
- Default to `false` — caller opts in to the special state

## Styling rules

All UIKit components use co-located static CSS. Import `Component.css` from the owning view, wrap
rules in `@layer uikit`, and
scope every selector from the component's `[data-type]` root. The startup layer order is
`@layer base, uikit, app, editor;`. Use established `data-part` names for internal structure;
do not rename them or replace state attributes with classes. Parent-owned descendant selectors are
allowed when they target a child's `[data-type]` or `[data-part]` and preserve the documented
owner relationship.

**An element inside a portalled branch needs a root-level `data-type` hook.** Scoping every
selector from the component's own `[data-type]` root is the rule, and it silently cannot work for
DOM the component renders into `#persephone-overlay-layer` — a popover's contents are not
descendants of the component root. Give that element its own `data-type` and select on it
unqualified. `[data-type="popover-resize-handle"]` and `[data-type="autocomplete-header"]` are the
two instances. Do not reach for `[data-type="popover"] > [data-part="…"]` (it claims every other
component's popover) or for `data-name` (which
[ui-element-contract.md](../../../doc/architecture/ui-element-contract.md) reserves as an addressing
handle, never a styling hook).

**Direct vanilla views must import borrowed styles explicitly.** A view that constructs another
converted component's DOM directly, or calls a shared attribute helper such as
`applyTextAttributes()`, cannot rely on another module's import to load CSS or on a type-only
component import to load CSS. Import the borrowed component stylesheet alongside the view's own
stylesheet. This keeps direct-view bundles correct when the view is loaded independently.

**The `[hidden]` counter-rule is required when a root sets `display`.** The browser's user-agent
`[hidden]` rule can lose to an author `display` rule, so every converted root whose stylesheet sets
`display` must also declare `<root-selector>[hidden] { display: none; }` in the same `@layer`.
Keep the selector scoped to that component root; app-owned roots use their own local equivalent.

### Colors

Never use hex codes, `rgb()`, or named colors. Always import from `color.ts`:
```ts
import color from "../../theme/color";
// (adjust relative path based on component subfolder depth)
```

If a needed color is missing from `color.ts`, add it there and in all theme definitions under `src/renderer/theme/themes/`.

### Design tokens

Use constants from `uikit/tokens.ts` for all spacing, sizing, border-radius, and font-size values:
```ts
import { spacing, radius, fontSize, height, gap } from "../tokens";
```

Never hardcode pixel values that exist in the token scale.

### Static CSS conventions

- Put all interactive states (`:hover`, `[data-*]`) in the component stylesheet; avoid scattered
  overrides elsewhere.
- Keep selectors rooted at the component's `data-type` and use token variables for presentation.

---

## Accessibility

- Always set `data-type` on the root element
- Use semantic HTML elements: `<button>` not `<div>` for clickable things, `<input>` for text input, etc.
- Forward `aria-*` and `role` props to the underlying element via `...rest`
- Never suppress the browser focus ring without providing an alternative focus indicator

---

## Component file template

```ts
import "./Button.css";
import { VanillaView } from "../shared/vanilla-view";

// --- Types ---

export interface ButtonProps {
    /** Optional debug label emitted as `data-name` on the root element. Use to disambiguate
     *  multiple instances of this primitive in DOM inspector output. Never used for styling. */
    name?: string;
    label: string;
    onClick: () => void;
    disabled?: boolean;
    variant?: "default" | "danger" | "ghost";
    size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
    icon?: string | Node;
}

export class ButtonView extends VanillaView<ButtonProps> {
    public constructor(props: ButtonProps) {
        super(props, document.createElement("button"));
    }

    protected onMount(): void {
        this.root.dataset.type = "button";
        this.root.textContent = this.props.label;
        this.listen(this.root, "click", this.handleClick);
    }

    private readonly handleClick = (): void => {
        if (!this.props.disabled) this.props.onClick();
    };
}
```

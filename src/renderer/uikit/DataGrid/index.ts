/**
 * The direct-import surface for av-grid-backed data-grid features.
 *
 * Keep this surface separate from the general UIKit barrel:
 *
 *  • `AVGrid` is the library's own exported class, so a Persephone component of that name would be
 *    permanently ambiguous. `DataGrid` is the unambiguous replacement.
 *  • The type names collide where the barrel would put them. `uikit/index.ts` already re-exports
 *    `Column` and `CellFocus` from another UIKit surface, and av-grid exports both names too. A shared
 *    general barrel put those names in the same namespace. The repo has
 *    namespace that combines both libraries would produce the
 *    `VirtualCellFunc` / `VirtualCellParams` aliases, where the survivor got the worse name
 *    because the corpse held the good one.
 *  • Direct imports are the project standard for this integration surface and keep each
 *    dependency explicit at its call site.
 *
 * Import from `"../../uikit/DataGrid"`, not from `"../../uikit"`.

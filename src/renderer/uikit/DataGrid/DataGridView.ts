/**
 * The mounting shim: one av-grid instance, owned by a `VanillaView`.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* a reconciliation layer. The view is a native host
 * for av-grid's imperative instance: the caller holds rows, columns, focus, selection and the edit path in state
 * and passes them down. av-grid is the opposite: `AVGrid.create()` returns an instance that *owns*
 * that state, and options are initial values. The inversion is absorbed by each consumer, in the
 * model that already owns its persisted view state. All this file does is mount, forward, and
 * dispose.
 *
 * ## Two prop tiers, and why
 *
 * `VanillaView.update(props)` has no prop-equality gate, so a parent view re-pushes the whole
 * props object on every one of its own updates, typically with fresh object and array literals.
 * Pushing all of it into `setOptions` would hand av-grid new `rows` / `columns` identities
 * constantly.
 *
 *  • **Callbacks** are bound once, at `create()`, as stable trampolines that read `this.props`
 *    live. Their identity is never re-pushed — an inline arrow in JSX changes identity on every
 *    render and would produce a `setOptions` call per render for nothing. Handler *behaviour*
 *    still updates, because the trampoline reads the current props when it fires. Only a change
 *    in **presence** is pushed, and only because presence is meaningful to av-grid: an
 *    `onGridContextMenu` that exists replaces the built-in menu, a `getRowKey` that exists
 *    suppresses key inference, and a `newRow` that exists overrides the default blank row. A
 *    trampoline for a prop the host never passed would silently return `undefined` into each of
 *    those decisions, so absent props get no trampoline at all.
 *  • **Values** are shallow-diffed by identity against the last pushed set, and only the changed
 *    keys reach `setOptions`.
 *
 * The value tier is derived by *exclusion*, not by an allow-list: any option av-grid adds in a
 * future version flows through without an edit here, which is the point of a shim whose props are
 * the library's own option names.

/**
 * The Persephone-facing type surface of av-grid.
 *
 * Everything a consumer needs is re-exported here so that no file outside this folder ever names
 * the package — the enforceable form of [EPIC-057 C4-1](../../../../doc/epics/EPIC-057.md), checked
 * by the `no-restricted-imports` block in `eslint.config.mjs`. A later decision to vendor the
 * library's source changes this folder's imports and nothing else.
 *
 * Names are av-grid's own, deliberately. This is a *mounting* shim, not a reconciliation layer
 * (C4-2), so a consumer reading av-grid's documentation finds the same option names in its props.

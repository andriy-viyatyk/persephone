/**
 * Hover a clipped cell, read its full value.
 *
 * The previous grid wrapped every string cell in `<TruncatedText>`, which gave each one
 * an ellipsis and a tooltip; av-grid gives the ellipsis (2.2.3) and no tooltip, because a
 * framework-free published grid cannot own Persephone's tooltip component, its delay, its theme,
 * or its coordination with the app's overlay and drag registries. So the tooltip is restored here,
 * once, in the seam every consumer mounts through (EPIC-057 / US-1024).
 *
 * ## One attachment, many targets
 *
 * `attachTooltip` binds its listeners to a trigger element and positions against it. Cells cannot
 * be that element: they are **pooled and recycled**, so `mouseenter` is not dependable on them
 * (av-grid's own hover tracking says so in `GridInteractions`, and uses `pointermove` for exactly
 * this reason), and an attachment would outlive its occupant — the element that showed row 5 shows
 * row 25 after a scroll, with the same identity.
 *
 * So the trigger is the **grid root**, permanently, and the hovered cell is supplied as a floating
 * UI *virtual anchor*. Events and identity come from the root; geometry comes from the cell. That
 * also gets the registries right for free: `overlayRegistry` suppression and `tooltipRegistry`'s
 * innermost-wins are both containment tests, and the root is the correct subject for both.
 *
 * ## Which cells, and what text
 *
 * Two gates, and neither is a list of exceptions:
 *
 *  1. **The element.** A candidate cell has an `.avg-cell-text` child — av-grid's own text wrapper,
 *     present for a plain and a search-matched cell and absent for a boolean, an open editor and
 *     anything a column's `render` hook produced. Clipping is then measured on that wrapper, which
 *     is a block container: the same `scrollWidth > clientWidth` measured on the *cell* is
 *     undetectable for a centred or right-aligned cell, because overflow in a `nowrap` flex line
 *     moves to the start side and is not part of the scrollable overflow region — and av-grid
 *     right-aligns every number by default, so that predicate would have silently never fired for
 *     a numeric column.
 *  2. **The text.** `columnDisplayValue`, normalised the way av-grid's own `displayText` does.
 *     Empty means no tooltip, which is how a graphical `render` column opts out: `formatValue` is
 *     already the library's plain-text projection — the rule it filters and copies by — so a column
 *     drawing an SVG or a row of buttons declares `formatValue: () => ""` for those reasons before
 *     this feature existed.
 *
 * Deliberately not `textContent`: it is nearly right for the two text shapes, and wrong the moment
 * a `render` column composes anything (the git tree's commit-subject cell would yield its ref-badge
 * names glued to the subject). A `render` column that *wants* hover-to-read emits
 * `<span class="avg-cell-text">` and gets the ellipsis with it.
 *
 * ## What suppresses it
 *
 * The two registries cover HTML5 drags and app popovers. Four things they cannot see:
 *
 *  • **A range-selection drag and a column-resize drag** are pointer-driven, not HTML5 drags. Both
 *    are covered by refusing to arm while any button is down and by closing on `pointerdown`.
 *    av-grid does expose `focus.isDragging`, which looks like the right gate and is not: before
 *    2.2.3 it latched on, and reading a version-dependent flag to decide a hover is worse than
 *    reading the button state that is already on the event.
 *  • **An open cell editor** — `grid.isEditing()`, plus the hovered cell's own `.avg-editing`.
 *  • **av-grid's own popovers** (filter, cell dropdown) are the library's DOM on `document.body`,
 *    so `overlayRegistry` has never heard of them — and the tooltip's `z-index` beats theirs, so
 *    without this it paints *over* an open filter popover. One observer registers them.

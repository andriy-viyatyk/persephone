/**
 * Renderer client for the main-process streaming command runner.
 *
 * `proc.execute(command, opts)` returns an {@link IExecuteHandle} — the
 * renderer side of the protocol in `src/ipc/runner-channels.ts`. The handle's
 * state machine lives in `src/shared/execute-handle.ts` (shared with the board
 * shim); this file supplies only the transport: per-job `ipcRenderer.on`
 * subscriptions filtered by `jobId`, with the start / stdin / kill messages
 * sent back on the same channels — mirroring `WorkerRunner.ts`. The runner
 * channels are ad-hoc strings (not in the typed `Endpoint` enum), hence the
 * `as unknown as never` casts — same as the worker system.

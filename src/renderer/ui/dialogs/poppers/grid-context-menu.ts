/**
 * Show av-grid's context menu through Persephone's own popup menu.
 *
 * This app-side adapter is the deliberate boundary for current DataGrid/av-grid context menus:
 * UIKit supplies the event and items, while the app shell supplies its popup and icons.
 *
 * It lives app-side because that is the whole point: `uikit/` may not reach into `ui/`, and a grid
 * that wants the application's menu therefore hands the event outward through
 * `onGridContextMenu` instead of calling the app shell itself.
 *
 * ## What actually needs adapting
 *
 * Not the item shape. av-grid's `MenuItem` and Persephone's (`core/events/context-menu.ts`) are
 * field-for-field identical — `label`, `onClick`, `disabled`, `invisible`, `startGroup`, `hotKey`,
 * `selected`, `minor`, `id`, `items` — and Persephone's `icon` is typed `any`, so av-grid's items
 * are already structurally assignable. There is no mapping to write.
 *
 * Only the icons. av-grid's built-in items carry **SVG source strings**, and the menu's icon slot
 * goes through `fillSlot`, which writes a string as `textContent` — so an unadapted item renders
 * its own `<svg …>` markup as visible text in the menu. That is what the stable `avg-` ids exist
 * for: match on the id, swap in the Persephone icon element, and the menu is indistinguishable
 * from the one the previous grid rendered.

/**
 * The fourteen ids av-grid 2.2.0 ships, and the icon each takes.
 *
 * Read from the av-grid built-in item contract, so the menu looks the same before and after
 * the migration. Match on the id and never on the label — the row labels carry a count and a
 * pluralised `rowNoun` (`Insert 3 links`), which is exactly why the ids were added upstream.
 *
 * The three `avg-copy-as-*` submenu children are deliberately absent: they carry no icon today.

/**

 *  • Only ids starting `avg-` are touched. Items a host contributed through
 *    `getContextMenuItems` share this array, and their icons already arrive as icon elements
 *    rather than the SVG source strings av-grid's own built-ins carry.
 *  • An unrecognised `avg-` id **drops** the icon rather than throwing. `showAppPopupMenu`
 *    substitutes `EmptyIcon` when any sibling has one, so a future built-in this table does not
 *    know degrades to alignment padding instead of raw SVG text.
